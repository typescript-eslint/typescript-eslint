      This is an extension rule. That means we take the base rule and extend it to support TS syntax or features.
      \
      We don't break from the base rule to add new features unless they are specifically related to TS.
      \
      In this instance â€” this request is not related to TS, thus we shall not implement it. If you'd like to see it, feel free to raise a request with the ESLint team.

      Thanks for the report @<reporter>!\
      I can't reproduce the issue using the code you provided.\
      Could you please create an isolated reproduction in our playground (https://typescript-eslint.io/play) and comment back when you've got one?\
      We prefer an isolated reproduction so that we as volunteer maintainers can quickly reproduce the issue and more easily find the cause.\
      Thanks!

      With any issue opened in this project â€” it either has visible progress in the form of an attached PR, or it has no progress.\
      \
      We are a community-run project. The volunteer maintainers spend most of their time triaging issues and reviewing PRs. This means that most issues will not progress unless a member of the community steps up and champions it.\
      \
      If this issue is important to you â€” consider being that champion.\
      \
      If not â€” please just subscribe to the issue and wait patiently.\
      Commenting asking for status updates does not bump issue priority in any way and just serves to spam everyone subscribed to the issue.

      We ***STRONGLY*** recommend you use automatic code formatters like [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier).
      \
      Stylistic lint rules take a lot of effort to write, require ongoing maintenance to add more configuration as people want to fit their preferences, and are a large burden to maintain as new syntax is added.
      The configurability also leads to huge fanout [making tests huge, and awful to maintain](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/b814e635c1f34139c89e0176727480935dd45cac/packages/eslint-plugin/tests/rules/type-annotation-spacing.test.ts).
      \
      It's for these reasons that [eslint has frozen all stylistic lint rule options, and will not accept any new ones](https://eslint.org/blog/2020/05/changes-to-rules-policies).
