          I'm the âš¡ TypeScript ESLint Formatting Bot âš¡, and I'm popping in automatically to advertise that we **strongly recommend against using ESLint rules for formatting purposes**.

          * [ESLint core has not accepted new stylistic rules for years](https://eslint.org/blog/2020/05/changes-to-rules-policies#what-are-the-changes)
          * Formatting rules are inherently difficult to maintain and will not catch many edge cases _(todo: docs link pending #4907)_
          * Dedicated formatting tools such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io) are much faster, more stable, and more comprehensive than ESLint can ever be for formatting.

          This message is automated and serves only as a reminder. We will still triage your issue and, as long as it only involves fixing existing formatting rules, do not plan on automatically closing it.
