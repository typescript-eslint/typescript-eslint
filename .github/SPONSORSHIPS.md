# Sponsorship

typescript-eslint is an entirely volunteer-run project.
We are not associated with any company or organization; our development is funded solely from community donations.

## Why Sponsor typescript-eslint?

Our tooling is used by the vast majority of TypeScript applications today, including nearly 10,000 dependent projects and 20 million weekly downloads on npm.
Our packages enable both ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code.
We additionally provide a comprehensive suite of TypeScript-focused ESLint rules that, by enabling access to TypeScript's type checking APIs, can detect classifications of application bugs more advanced than ESLint alone can.
Sponsoring typescript-eslint helps keep our development process running reliably, which in turn directly allows us to:

- Support new versions of TypeScript sooner after their release
- Continue improving our documentation and first-run experiences
- Fix bugs and add new features to existing rules
- Write more advanced rules to solve more areas of application correctness

### Sponsorship Benefits

In addition to benefitting the TypeScript ecosystem, sponsoring us on Open Collective helps promote your company and development brand.
Our top sponsors may have their link, logo, and/or name featured on the homepage of [typescript-eslint.io](https://typescript-eslint.io).

At present, sponsors must have given at least $100 to be featured on the homepage.
Placement tiers are based on total donations:

- Platinum sponsors: Top 6 donators
- Gold supporters: The next 10 donators
- Silver supporters: The next 18 donators

You can always view all financial contributors on [opencollective.com/typescript-eslint](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint).

## Sponsorship Limitations

### Project Direction

typescript-eslint is always appreciative of organizations sponsoring the project.
However, we do not factor sponsorship amounts into issue prioritization or pull request reviews.
If you have a need to push forward an area of work in typescript-eslint more urgently than a general donation can provide, consider donating engineering time as well.

### Website Placement

We are inclusive by default and allow all organizations that newly meet a monetary threshold to be added.
However, at our discretion, we may remove organizations we feel we cannot promote in good conscience.
Organizations would most commonly be removed if their core charter and/or repeated organization-wide intentional activities:

- Deny fundamental human rights
- Repeatedly spread large-scale harmful misinformation online
- Finance and/or promote other organizations that match these issues

If you disagree with a choice made by the maintenance team, or would like a refund for your sponsorship, please let us know by emailing `typescripteslint@gmail.com`.
