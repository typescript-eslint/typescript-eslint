        # What is a "Base Rule Extension"?
        In some cases, ESLint provides a rule itself, but it doesn't support TypeScript syntax; either it crashes, or it ignores the syntax, or it falsely reports against it.
        In these cases, we create what we call an extension rule; a rule within our plugin that has the same functionality, but also supports TypeScript.
