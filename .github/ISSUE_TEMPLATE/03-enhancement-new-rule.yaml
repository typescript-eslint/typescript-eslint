        If you answered no to one or more of the above, then your rule *likely* doesn't belong in this project, and will *likely* be rejected.
        That doesn't mean your proposal isn't useful! It just means you should consider either proposing it to another project (like [eslint-plugin-unicorn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn)), or publishing it in a new plugin.
