        - You can't reproduce the issue in the playground
        - Your issue requires some complex setup - such as multiple files or a specific folder structure.

        Please do not just paste your entire ESLint config - it just makes it harder for us to investigate.
        If this is more than around 30 lines and/or contains lint rule settings unrelated to your bug report, you probably haven't isolated the repro.
