# `@typescript-eslint/utils`

> Utilities for working with TypeScript + ESLint together. âœ¨

This package contains public utilities for writing custom rules and plugins in TypeScript.
Rules declared in [`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`](https://typescript-eslint.io/architecture/eslint-plugin) are created using these utility functions.
Any custom rules you write generally will be as well.

> See [Custom Rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/custom-rules) for documentation on creating your own custom ESLint rules for TypeScript code.
