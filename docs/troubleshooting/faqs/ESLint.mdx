## Why is a rule from ESLint core not working correctly with TypeScript code?

This happens because TypeScript adds new features that ESLint doesn't know about.

The first step is to [check our list of "extension" rules here](/rules/#extension-rules).
An extension rule is a rule which extends the base ESLint rules to support TypeScript syntax.
If you find it in there, give it a go to see if it works for you.
You can configure it by disabling the base rule, and turning on the extension rule.
Here's an example with the `semi` rule:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "semi": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/semi": "error"
  }
}
```

If you don't find an existing extension rule, or the extension rule doesn't work for your case, then you can go ahead and check our issues.
[The contributing guide outlines the best way to raise an issue](../../contributing/Issues.mdx).

## I get errors from the `no-undef` rule about global variables not being defined, even though there are no TypeScript errors

The `no-undef` lint rule does not use TypeScript to determine the global variables that exist - instead, it relies upon ESLint's configuration.

We strongly recommend that you do not use the `no-undef` lint rule on TypeScript projects.
The checks it provides are already provided by TypeScript without the need for configuration - TypeScript just does this significantly better.

As of our v4.0.0 release, this also applies to types.
If you use global types from a 3rd party package (i.e. anything from an `@types` package), then you will have to configure ESLint appropriately to define these global types.
For example; the `JSX` namespace from `@types/react` is a global 3rd party type that you must define in your ESLint config.

Note, that for a mixed project including JavaScript and TypeScript, the `no-undef` rule (like any rule) can be turned off for TypeScript files alone as follows:

<Tabs groupId="eslint-config">
<TabItem value="Flat Config">

```js title="eslint.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'eslint/config';

export default defineConfig(
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx,mts,cts}'],
    rules: {
      'no-undef': 'off',
    },
  },
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Legacy Config">

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['*.ts', '*.mts', '*.cts', '*.tsx'],
      rules: {
        'no-undef': 'off',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you choose to leave on the ESLint `no-undef` lint rule, you can [manually define the set of allowed `globals` in your ESLint config](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-globals), and/or you can use one of the [pre-defined environment (`env`) configurations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-environments).

## I get errors from the `@typescript-eslint/no-namespace` and/or `no-var` rules about declaring global variables

Two common solutions in TypeScript for declaring the existence of a global variable include:

- `declare global` with a `var`, which violates [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-var):

  ```ts
  declare global {
    var myValue: string;
    // Unexpected var, use let or const instead. eslint (no-var)
  }

  myValue;
  ```

- `declare namespace globalThis`, which violates [`@typescript-eslint/no-namespace`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-namespace):

  ```ts
  declare namespace globalThis {
    // ES2015 module syntax is preferred over namespaces. eslint (@typescript-eslint/no-namespace)
    let myValue: string;
  }

  globalThis.myValue;
  ```

[Using global variables is generally discouraged](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10525582/why-are-global-variables-considered-bad-practice).
If possible, it's best to avoid declaring globals altogether.

If you absolutely must use one of the two strategies, then you can use an [ESLint configuration comment](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) to disable rules as needed.
For example:

```ts
declare global {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var -- Provided by an old third-party integration.
  var myValue: string;
}
```

:::tip
Whenever you need to disable an ESLint rule, it's best to include an informative comment explaining why.
:::

See [#9582](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/9582 'typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#9582 Docs: globalThis without ignores of no-var and no-namespace') and [#7941](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7941 'typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#7941 Base rule extension: no-var configuration for declarations') for discussions around typescript-eslint supporting these use cases.

## Can I use ESLint's `--cache` with typescript-eslint?

[ESLint's `--cache` option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#caching) caches on a per-file basis.
You can use it, but it will only work reliably for untyped rules -- and even then, not always.

Any ESLint rule that checks logic across files, including many rules from `eslint-plugin-import`, creates cross-file dependencies.
[Typed lint rules](../../getting-started/Typed_Linting.mdx) almost always have dependencies on types across files in practice.
ESLint's caching doesn't account for those cross-file dependencies.

We don't recommend using `--cache`.
