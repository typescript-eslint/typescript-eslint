# Getting Started

Approaching a monorepo project like this can be pretty daunting and hard to navigate for a new user.

The goal of these docs are to give you a quick overview of the project and all of its the pieces, as well as provide guides to help you get setup.

The docs are broken down into the following categories:

## [I want to lint my TypeScript codebase.](./linting/README.md)

## [(TODO) I want to write an ESLint plugin in TypeScript.](./plugin-development/README.md)
