Thank you for your interest in developing on typescript-eslint! ❤️‍🔥

> See [Contributing](../Contributing.mdx) and [Issues](./Issues.mdx) for details on our general contribution flows.

## Setup

After [forking the repo from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [installing Yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/typescript-eslint
cd typescript-eslint
yarn
```

Postinstall scripts will then fully build your repository locally with (`yarn build`).
At this point, you're ready to develop! 🚀

## Builds

You can run `yarn build` in the root to build all packages, or in any package to build just that package.

Keep in mind that packages generally depend on each other's built outputs, and you'll need to `yarn build` dependents for their consumers to receive any new local changes.
For example, if you make a change within `scope-manager` and want to use it in `eslint-plugin`, you'll need to `yarn build` either from the root or within `packages/scope-manager`.

## Validating Changes

The following checks are all run on pull requests automatically.
You can also perform them locally.

> See [Contributing > Pull Requests](../Contributing.mdx#raising-a-pr) for more information on pull requests.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to auto-format code.
A Git pre-commit hook should apply it to all committed changes.
ALternately, you can run `yarn format` in any package or in the root.

### Linting

All code changes must pass ESLint.
You can run `yarn lint` in any package or in the root.

### Proofreading

Changes must pass two linters for documentation and naming, the commands for which may be run from the root:

- `yarn check-spelling`: [CSpell](https://cspell.org), for all code
- `yarn lint-markdown`: [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), for Markdown documentation

### Tests

All code changes should ideally be unit tested if possible.
You can run `yarn test` in any package to run its tests.

> [VS Code launch tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) tasks are provided that allow [visual debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) tests.

#### Code Coverage

We aim for 100% code coverage in all PRs when possible, except in the `website/` package.
Coverage reports are be generated locally whenever `yarn test` is run.

The `codecov` bot should also comment on your PR with the percentage, as well as links to the line-by-line coverage of each file touched by your PR.

### Type Checking

All code should pass TypeScript type checking.
You can run `yarn typecheck` in any package or in the root to run `tsc`.

> Run `yarn typecheck -w` to start `tsc` in watch mode.

## Website Development

Our interactive documentation website is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).
Running `yarn start` from either the root or `packages/website` will start a local dev server on `localhost:3000`.

> The `website` package relies on other packages being built.
> We recommend running `yarn build` from the root before `yarn start`.
