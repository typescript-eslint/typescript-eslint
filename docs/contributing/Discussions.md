Most proposals in the typescript-eslint repository happen in [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/issues).
We generally try to keep conversations inside issues for their discoverability and ability to be linked to [GitHub Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests).

We have [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions) enabled to enable three kinds of deeper, threaded conversations:

- **Community Feedback**: Questions from the maintainer team that should be raised to the broader community
- **RFCs (Requests For Comments)**: Formalized proposals for larger changes that should be discussed before turned into issues
- **Technical Discussions**: Deeper questions about typescript-eslint's architecture and/or APIs

Before filing a Discussion, search the issue tracker for any related conversations.
Link to them in the Discussion, along with a detailed description of what you'd like to discuss.

:::tip
For change proposals that match an [existing issue format](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/new/choose), keep to filing issues.
Most don't need to be moved to this separate format.
We can always move an issue to a discussion if it becomes unexpectedly deep.

:::caution
Please don't use Discussions as a support forum.
See [Issues > Questions and Support Requests](./Issues.mdx#questions-and-support-requests).
