So you've got changes locally that address an issue?
Fantastic!

Please do:

- Only send pull requests that resolve [open issues marked as `accepting prs`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22accepting+prs%22)
  - One exception: extremely minor documentation typos
- Fill out the pull request template in full
- Validate your changes per [Development > Validating Changes](./Local_Development.mdx#validating-changes) before un-[drafting your PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests)

Please don't:

- Force push after opening a PR
  - Reasoning: GitHub is not able to track changes across force pushes, which makes it take longer for us to perform incremental reviews
- Comment on an existing PR asking for updates
  - Reasoning: Your PR hasn't been forgotten! The volunteer maintainers have limited time to work on the project, and they will get to it as soon as they are able.
    - One exception: if a PR has been blocked on a question to a maintainer for 3 or more months, please ping us - we probably lost track of it.

### Raising a PR

Once your changes are ready, you can raise a PR! ðŸ™Œ
The title of your PR should match the following format:

```text
<type>(<package>): <short description>
```

You can find more samples of good past PR titles in [recent commits to `main`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/commits/main):

- `fix(scope-manager): correct handling for class static blocks`
- `docs: Fix links to getting started in README.md`

Within the body of your PR, make sure you reference the issue that you have worked on, as well as pointing out anything of note you wish us to look at during our review.

> We do not care about the number, or style of commits in your history, because we squash merge every PR into `main`.
> Feel free to commit in whatever style you feel comfortable with.

> Tip: Send the PR from a branch other than `main`.
> See GitHub's [Proposing Changes docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) for more information.

#### type

Must be one of the following:

<!-- Keep this synchronized with /.github/workflows/semantic-pr-titles.yml -->

- `docs` - if you only change documentation, and not shipped code
- `feat` - for any new functionality additions
- `fix` - for any bug fixes that don't add new functionality
- `test` - if you only change tests, and not shipped code
- `chore` - anything else

#### package

The name of the package you have made changes within, (e.g. `eslint-plugin`, `parser`, `typescript-estree`).
If you make significant changes across multiple packages, you can omit this (e.g.
`feat: foo bar`).

#### short description

A succinct title for the PR.

### Addressing Feedback and Beyond

With your PR raised and the CI passing, your PR will [wait in the queue to be reviewed](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc+-label%3A%22breaking+change%22+-label%3A%22awaiting+response%22+-label%3A%221+approval%22+-label%3A%22DO+NOT+MERGE%22+status%3Asuccess).
We generally review PRs oldest to newest, unless we consider a newer PR higher priority (e.g. if it's a bug fix).

Once we have reviewed your PR, we will provide any feedback that needs addressing.
If you feel a requested change is wrong, don't be afraid to discuss with us in the comments.

Please post comments as [line comments](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request) when possible, so that they can be threaded.
You can [resolve conversations](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations) on your own when you feel they're resolved - no need to comment explicitly and/or wait for a maintainer.

Once you've addressed all our feedback by making code changes and/or started a followup discussion, [re-request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review) from each maintainer whose feedback you addressed.

Once the feedback is addressed, and the PR is approved, we'll ensure the branch is up to date with `main`, and merge it for you.
