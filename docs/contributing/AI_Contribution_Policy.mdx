title: AI Contribution Policy
---

With the rise of AI-assisted coding tools, it has become easier than ever to generate large amounts of low-quality contributions, for PRs and issues.
Parsing, reviewing, and iterating on these in good faith takes up much more maintainer bandwidth than traditional contributions, taking away bandwidth from other opportunities to advance typescript-eslint.

While we cannot and will not attempt to ban contributions which make use of AI, we ask that you use AI responsibly:

1. Always review AI-generated code closely before submitting a PR.

1. Only use AI to assist in contributions that you would understand well enough to work on and respond to feedback on without making use of AI.

1. Do not ignore our issue and PR templates.

1. Avoid AI-generated content in written, non-code contributions (issues/comments/PR descriptions, etc.).
   AI-generated PR descriptions in particular tend to just be nearly-verbatim descriptions of the code diff, which add no value to the PR.
   Instead, we ask that you summarize the PR succinctly in your own words, relying on your own understanding of the code.

Pull requests and issues that do not appear to follow these guidelines may be closed at maintainers' discretion.

Don't let this dissuade you from contributing to typescript-eslint!
We very much welcome new contributors and are happy to help them improve.
We just cannot afford to spend our time supporting contributors who primarily defer to AI coding assistants; at that point it'd be a better use of our time to prompt the LLM ourselves.
