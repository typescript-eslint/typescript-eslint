So you've got a bug report, documentation request, or feature suggestion?
Great!

Please do:

- Make sure you're using the [latest version of our packages](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/releases)
- Search [all opened and closed issues](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) to make sure your issue wouldn't be a duplicate
- Fill out the [appropriate issue template](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/new/choose) completely
- Provide as much information as you can

## Commenting

Please do comment on any open issue if you have more information that would be useful.

Please don't:

- Leave useless comments such as _"+1"_ or _"when's this getting fixed?"_ that only act as spam
  - If you have nothing to add but enthusiasm and joy, add a reaction such as 👍
- Bring up unrelated topics in existing issues: instead, file a new issue
- Comment on closed PRs: instead, [file a new issue](#raising-issues)
- Comment on commits directly, as those comments are not searchable: instead, file a new issue

## Questions and Support Requests

We do not have the bandwidth to handle questions or support requests in the issue tracker.
You can instead:

- Ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/TypeScript-ESLint 'StackOverflow questions tagged with typescript-eslint') using the `typescript-eslint` tag
- Publicly tweet [@tseslint on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tseslint)

> Note that requests to add documentation _are_ allowed, even encouraged! 📝
