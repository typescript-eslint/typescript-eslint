So you've got a bug report, documentation request, or feature suggestion?
Great!

Please do:

- Make sure you're using the [latest version of our packages](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/releases)
- Search [all opened and closed issues](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) to make sure your issue wouldn't be a duplicate
- Fill out the [appropriate issue template](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/new/choose) completely
- Provide as much information as you can

## Commenting

Please do comment on any open issue if you have more information that would be useful.

Please don't:

- Leave useless comments such as _"+1"_ or _"when's this getting fixed?"_ that only act as spam
  - If you have nothing to add but enthusiasm and joy, add a reaction such as 👍
  - One exception: if an issue has been blocked on a question to a maintainer for 3 or more months, please ping us - we probably lost track of it
- Bring up unrelated topics in existing issues: instead, file a new issue
- Comment on closed PRs: instead, [file a new issue](#raising-issues)
- Comment on commits directly, as those comments are not searchable: instead, file a new issue

### Issue Claiming

We don't use any kind of issue claiming system.
We've found in the past that they result in accidental ["licked cookie"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091201-00/?p=15843) situations where contributors claim an issue but run out of time or energy trying before sending a PR.

If an issue has been marked as `accepting prs` and an open PR does not exist, feel free to send a PR.
You don't need to ask for permission.

## Finding Issues

Consider searching through:

1. [Unassigned user-facing marked as `accepting prs` and `good first issue`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22accepting+prs%22+-label%3A%22repo+maintenance%22+no%3Aassignee): to find issues marked as good for a first-timer
2. [Unassigned user-facing marked as `accepting prs` without `good first issue`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22accepting+prs%22+-label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+-label%3A%22repo+maintenance%22+no%3Aassignee): once you've finished a few issues, to find more intermediate-level issues

## "Evaluating Community Engagement"

The typescript-eslint project has limited maintenance bandwidth and cannot commit to every potentially valid issue.
It can be difficult to tell if some issues' impacts would be worth taking bandwidth away from other, higher-impact issues.
For those issues, we will:

1. Add an `evaluating community engagement` label to indicate the issue is under review
2. Wait at least 3-6 months
3. Either accept or decline the issue, depending on how much engagement the issue receives

If your issue is marked as `evaluating community engagement`, we encourage you to:

- Socialize the issue online to find other users who are in favor of it
- Try out the proposed changes in your own projects
  - If the issue is for a new lint rule, consider using our [Building ESLint Plugins documentation](https://typescript-eslint.io/developers/eslint-plugins) to create a standalone plugin users can try

See [Maintenance > Issues > Community Engagement Evaluation](https://typescript-eslint.io/maintenance/issues/#community-engagement-evaluation) for documentation on our corresponding maintenance practices.

## Questions and Support Requests

The issue tracker is not an appropriate place for questions or support requests.
You can instead:

- Ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FSxKq8Tdyg)'s `#help` server
- Ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript-eslint 'StackOverflow questions tagged with typescript-eslint') using the `typescript-eslint` tag
- Publicly tag [@typescript-eslint.io on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/typescript-eslint.io) or [@tseslint on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@tseslint)

> Note that requests to add documentation _are_ allowed, even encouraged! 📝
