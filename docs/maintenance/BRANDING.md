This document serves as a guide for how we generally describe or represent TypeScript-ESLint.
It's fine if you don't always adhere to it.

## Terminology

### Name

Our project name is **_"TypeScript-ESLint"_**.
We sometimes refer to it as _"TSESLint"_ for short.

_"`typescript-eslint`"_ refers to the code repository, GitHub organization, and NPM organization.

### Slogan

> The tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to support TypeScript.

## Visuals

Our primary brand color is `#2656c7`, the halfway point between ESLint's `#4b32c3` purple and TypeScript's `#007acc` blue.
You can call it _blurple_ if you want.

Our logo is also a halfway between [ESLint's logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESLint#/media/File:ESLint_logo.svg) and [TypeScript's logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript#/media/File:Typescript.svg):
