This document serves as a guide for how you might review pull requests.

Use your best judgement when reviewing PRs, and most of all remember to be **kind, friendly, and encouraging** when responding to users.
Many users are new to open source and/or typed linting.
It's imperative we give them a positive, uplifting experience.

:::tip
If you're ever unsure on any part of PR reviews, don't hesitate to loop in a maintainer who has more context to help!

## Governance

Per the scales from [Contribution Tiers > Pointing](./Contributor_Tiers.mdx#pointing):

- Straightforward: At reviewer discretion, may be merged with a single approval by any committer or maintainer.
  This includes docs enhancements, bug fixes, and feature additions.
- Non-straightforward: may be merged with either two committer approvals or one maintainer approval.
  These include multi-package internal refactors and non-breaking public API changes.
- "Unusual"-categorized: require two maintainer approvals.
  These include significant refactors with cross-project and public API ramifications.

## PR Review Flow

:::note
We include a set of common responses to PRs in [`.github/replies.yml`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/.github/replies.yml), intended to be used with the [Refined Saved Replies](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/refined-saved-replies) extension.
Don't treat these as exact responses you must use: they're just a starting copy+paste helper.
Please do adopt your specific responses to your personal tone and to match the thread for non-straightforward PRs.
:::

Open pull requests ideally switch between two states:

- Ready for review: either newly created or after [review is re-requested](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review)
- Waiting for author activity: either by virtue of [being a draft](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) or having the [`awaiting response` label](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22awaiting+response%22)

Add the `awaiting response` label to a PR whenever you post a review.
It will be automatically removed if the author re-requests review.

### Be Kind

Above all else, be _encouraging_ and _friendly_ in tone.

- Phrase feedback as opportunities for improvement rather than chastising.
- Call out any positive aspects you see - especially in larger pull requests.
- Use happy emojis frequently.
- If you have the energy, post a fun (but not inappropriate) GIF with your review.
  - We often use the _GIFs for Github_ extension: available as [GIFs for GitHub (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gifs-for-github/dkgjnpbipbdaoaadbdhpiokaemhlphep) and [GIFs for GitHub (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gifs-for-github).

Pull requests are the first time many community members meaningfully interact with us - or, oftentimes, any open source maintainers at all.
It's important that we provide a positive, uplifting experience. ❤️

### Reviewing a PR

Before reviewing a pull request, try to look back over the backing issue to (re-)familiarize yourself with it.
You may find it useful to:

- Attempt to simplify the provided reduction (["code golf"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf))
- Look back through previous issues and PRs around the same area of code / lint rule

If there's no backing issue:

- If the PR is a straightforward docs or tooling fix that doesn't impact users, it's ok to review it as-is
- Otherwise, add the `please fill out the template` label and post a comment like the _Needs Issue_ template

Upon completing your review, if the build is passing and you feel comfortable merging it in, go ahead and squash merge.
Otherwise, add the `1 approval` label.

#### Common Things to Look For

- Style: that can you read through the code easily, there are comments for necessary tricky areas, and not unnecessary comments otherwise.
  - Try not to nitpick things that don't matter.
  - If something is standard in the repo but not enforced, consider mentioning it as a non-blocking comment and filing an issue to enforce it.
- Thoroughness: does it handle relevant edge cases? Commonly:
  - Generics and type parameters (see: `getConstrainedTypeAtLocation`).
  - Parenthesis and whitespace (see: `getWrappingFixer`).
  - Unions and intersections (see: `unionTypeParts` and `intersectionTypeParts`).
- Unit tests:
  - All lines are covered per the Codecov / `yarn jest path/to/impacted/file --coverage` report.
  - Both "positive" and "negative" ("valid" and "invalid") cases exist, if reasonably possible to test for.
  - Fixes and suggestions, if present, don't remove `//` or `/*` comments
  - `invalid` lint rule errors include line and column information
  - Valid syntax edge cases don't cause the rule to crash, even if they cause a type error in TypeScript

#### Individual Comments

Post about one comment per area of praise note, suggested change, or non-actionable note.
It's fine to use multiple ancillary comments to indicate _"(also here)"_ notes, but don't overwhelm with requests.

:::tip
If you're posting more than a couple types of comments, consider prefixing them with category indicators such as `[Docs]`, `[Praise]`, `[Testing]`, etc.
This helps avoid the review feeling like a huge slog of big requests.
:::

Be clear in each of your comments what you're looking for or saying.
Err on the side of providing more information than you think is needed.

Try to default to a questioning tone for points that aren't clear bugs.
Encourage authors to think on your suggestions: _"I think (xyz), but am not sure - what do you think?"_.

#### Preliminary or Repeat Reviews

Sometimes you may want to post a preliminary review, and/or realize later on you missed something in an earlier review.
Both are reasonable and fine.

For preliminary reviews, be clear with what scale you're reviewing at: _"Reviewing on architecture now, will look in more detail once it's settled"_.

For repeat reviews, be clear when it's something you missed earlier and/or there's new information.
Don't apologize if the missed information was only made clear because of requested changes - this is part of the review process!

### Other States

#### External Blockers

If the PR is blocked on something, such as an external API or discussion in an issue, add the appropriate `blocked by *` label.
Explain why in a comment that links to at least a tracking issue for the blocker.

#### Out-of-Band Questions

Authors sometimes separately ask questions as comments on PRs, sometimes including an `@` tag.
Put back the `awaiting response` label if you answer the questions.
Don't worry if you miss some of these questions; we prefer going through the formal re-requesting review to make sure the `awaiting response` label is removed as needed.

## Pruning Old PRs

Every so often, we like to [search for open PRs `awaiting response`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22awaiting+response%22) to find ones that might have been forgotten.
Our flow for PRs that have been waiting for >=1 month is:

1. Ping the author with a message like the _Checking In_ template
2. Add the `stale` label to the PR
3. Wait 2 weeks
4. If they still haven't responded, close the PR with a message like the _Pruning Stale PR_ template

## Searching for PRs

Assorted other queries for PRs include:

- [All PRs you commented on](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+commenter%3A%40me)
- [All non-draft, non-`awaiting response` PRs](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+-label%3A%22awaiting+response%22+-is%3Adraft)
- [All non-draft, non-`awaiting response` PRs not blocked or already approved](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+-label%3A%22awaiting+response%22+-is%3Adraft+-label%3A%22blocked+by+another+PR%22+-label%3A%22blocked+by+another+issue%22+-label%3A%22blocked+by+external+API%22+-review%3Aapproved+)

If you have time, consider occasionally looking through old PRs to make sure there aren't any questions left unanswered for weeks.
