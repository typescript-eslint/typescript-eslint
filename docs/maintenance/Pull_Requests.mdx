This document serves as a guide for how you might review pull requests.

Use your best judgement when reviewing PRs, and most of all remember to be **kind, friendly, and encouraging** when responding to users.
Many users are new to open source and/or typed linting.
It's imperative we give them a positive, uplifting experience.

:::tip
If you're ever unsure on any part of PR reviews, don't hesitate to loop in a maintainer that has more context to help!

## Governance

Per the scales from [Contribution Tiers > Pointing](./Contributor_Tiers.mdx#pointing):

- Straightforward: At reviewer discretion, may be merged with a single approval by any committer or maintainer.
  This includes docs enhancements, bug fixes, and feature additions.
- Non-straightforward: may be merged with either two committer approvals or one maintainer approval.
  These include multi-package internal refactors and non-breaking public API changes.
- "Unusual"-categorized: require two maintainer approvals.
  These include significant refactors with cross-project and public API ramifications.

## PR Flow

:::note
We include a set of common responses to PRs in [`.github/replies.yml`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/.github/replies.yml), intended to be used with the [Refined Saved Replies](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/refined-saved-replies) extension.
Don't treat these as exact responses you must use: they're just a starting copy+paste helper.
Please do adopt your specific responses to your personal tone and to match the thread for non-straightforward PRs.

TODO: This will be filled out... soon!

## Pruning Old PRs

Every so often, we like to [search for open PRs `awaiting response`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22awaiting+response%22) to find ones that might have been forgotten.
Our flow for PRs that have been waiting for >=1 month is:

1. Ping the author with a message like the _Checking In_ template
2. Add the `stale` label to the PR
3. Wait 2 weeks
4. If they still haven't responded, close the PR with a message like the _Pruning Stale PR_ template

## Suggestions

Consider adding fun to PR reviews with GIFs.
The benefits of using GIFs in PR reviews are that it adds a touch of humor and lightheartedness to the process, builds camaraderie and team spirit, and can help break the ice by making users feel welcomed.
Please remember to use appropriate and respectful GIFs and use them sparingly; GIFs should enhance the conversation, not detract from it.

> We like to use the _GIFs for Github_ extension: available as [GIFs for GitHub (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gifs-for-github/dkgjnpbipbdaoaadbdhpiokaemhlphep) and [GIFs for GitHub (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gifs-for-github). ✨
