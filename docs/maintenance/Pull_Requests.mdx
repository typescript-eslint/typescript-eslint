This document serves as a guide for how you might review pull requests.

Use your best judgement when reviewing PRs, and most of all remember to be **kind, friendly, and encouraging** when responding to users.
Many users are new to open source and/or typed linting.
It's imperative we give them a positive, uplifting experience.

:::tip
If you're ever unsure on any part of PR reviews, don't hesitate to loop in a maintainer that has more context to help!

## PR Flow

:::note
We include a set of common responses to PRs in [`.github/replies.yml`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/.github/replies.yml), intended to be used with the [Refined Saved Replies](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/refined-saved-replies) extension.
Don't treat these as exact responses you must use: they're just a starting copy+paste helper.
Please do adopt your specific responses to your personal tone and to match the thread for non-straightforward PRs.

## Pruning Old PRs

Every so often, we like to [search for open PRs `awaiting response`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22awaiting+response%22) to find ones that might have been forgotten.
Our flow for PRs that have been waiting for >=1 month is:

1. Ping the author with a message like the _Checking In_ template
2. Add the `stale` label to the PR
3. Wait 2 weeks
4. If they still haven't responded, close the PR with a message like the _Pruning Stale PR_ template

## Suggestions

Add some fun to PR reviews with GIFs. It's a great way to create a fun and welcoming environment while still maintaining a professional and productive one. The benefits of using GIFs in PR reviews are that it adds a touch of humor and lightheartedness to the process, builds camaraderie and team spirit, and can help break the ice by making users feel welcomed. Please remember to use appropriate and respectful GIFs and use them sparingly; GIFs should enhance the conversation, not detract from it. Check out [GIFs for Github here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gifs-for-github/dkgjnpbipbdaoaadbdhpiokaemhlphep) or [for Firefox here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gifs-for-github/). Have some fun with it and happy GIF-ing.
