title: Maintenance Guide
---

This is the maintainers guide to working on typescript-eslint.
It's intended for use by contributors who have been given access to at least triage issues and pull requests.
We keep it in the open for visibility into our processes.

:::info Welcome!
If you're reading this as a new maintainer: welcome!
We're happy to have you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

## Governance

We follow a loose governance model that covers roles on the maintenance team and their associated responsibilities.
We see a few major benefits from doing so:

- We want it to be clear how & why we do the things we do _(especially around compensation and expectations around roles)_
- We want community input to make sure we're doing things the right way & focusing on truly useful improvements
- As we add to the processes over time, it'll be easier to make those changes clear & reviewable by everyone

The following pages are a rough "v1.x" of our governance.
We do our best to roughly adhere to this model - though at times we may shortcut tasks if there is no downside in doing so.

### Changes to Governance

Any changes to this document will be posted for open discussion on the [typescript-eslint GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/discussions) and kept open for at least one month.
The discussion will be shared at the beginning, middle, and end of that month on Discord and all our social media accounts.

## Providing Feedback

We're always receptive to suggestions on how to improve our processes!
For general feedback, we'd suggest posting in the [`#development` channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1026804805894672454/1088474511759917106).
We can help you turn that into a GitHub discussion.

:::note
Please be kind: open source governance is an unsolved challenge.
We might not know what impractical or non-ideal things we're doing.
If there's anything sensitive you don't feel comfortable talking about in public, you can always DM or email one of the maintainers privately.
