[ESLint shareable configurations](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/developer-guide/shareable-configs) exist to provide a comprehensive base config for you.
`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` includes built-in configurations you can extend from to pull in the recommended starting rules.

> With the exception of `strict`, all configurations are considered "stable".
> Rule additions and removals are treated as breaking changes and will only be done in major version bumps.

## Recommended Configurations

Most projects should extend from at least one of:

- [`recommended`](#recommended): Recommended rules for code correctness that you can drop in without additional configuration.
- [`recommended-requiring-type-checking`](#recommended-requiring-type-checking): Additional recommended rules that require type information.
- [`strict`](#strict): Additional strict rules that can also catch bugs but are more opinionated than recommended rules.

:::tip
We recommend most projects use [`recommended-requiring-type-checking`](#recommended-requiring-type-checking) (which requires [typed linting](./TYPED_LINTING.md)).
:::

:::note
These configurations are our recommended starting points, but **you don't need to use them as-is**.
ESLint allows configuring own rule settings on top of extended configurations.
See [ESLint's Configuring Rules docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/rules#using-configuration-files).
:::

### `recommended`

Recommended rules for code correctness that you can drop in without additional configuration.
These rules are those whose reports are almost always for a bad practice and/or likely bug.
`recommended` also disables rules known to conflict with this repository, or cause issues in TypeScript codebases.

```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"]
}
```

:::tip
We strongly recommend all TypeScript projects extend from this configuration.
:::

<configuration-contents name="recommended" />

### `recommended-requiring-type-checking`

Additional recommended rules that require type information.
Rules in this configuration are similarly useful to those in `recommended`.

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking"
  ]
}
```

:::tip
We recommend all TypeScript projects extend from this configuration, with the caveat that rules using type information take longer to run.
See [Linting with Type Information](/docs/linting/typed-linting) for more details.
:::

<configuration-contents name="recommended-requiring-type-checking" />

### `strict`

Additional strict rules that can also catch bugs but are more opinionated than recommended rules.

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict"
  ]
}
```

:::caution
We recommend a TypeScript project extend from this configuration only if a nontrivial percentage of its developers are highly proficient in TypeScript.
:::

<configuration-contents name="strict" />

## Other Configurations

TypeScript ESLint includes a scattering of utility configurations used by the recommended configurations.
We don't recommend using these directly; instead, extend from an earlier recommended rule.

### `all`

Enables each the rules provided as a part of TypeScript ESLint.
Note that many rules are not applicable in all codebases, or are meant to be configured.

<configuration-contents name="all" />

### `base`

A minimal ruleset that sets only the required parser and plugin options needed to run TypeScript ESLint.

<configuration-contents expanded name="base" />

This config is automatically included if you use any of the recommended configurations.

### `eslint-recommended`

This ruleset is meant to be used after extending `eslint:recommended`.
It disables core ESLint rules that are already checked by the TypeScript compiler.
Additionally, it enables rules that promote using the more modern constructs TypeScript allows for.

```jsonc
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended"
  ]
}
```

This config is automatically included if you use any of the recommended configurations.

<configuration-contents name="eslint-recommended" />

## Suggesting Configuration Changes

If you feel strongly that a specific rule should (or should not) be one of these configurations, please [file an issue](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/new?assignees=&labels=package%3A+eslint-plugin%2Cpreset+config+change%2Ctriage&template=09-config-change.yaml&title=Configs%3A+%3Ca+short+description+of+my+proposal%3E) along with a **detailed** argument explaining your reasoning.

## Formatting

None of the preset configs provided by TypeScript ESLint enable formatting rules (rules that only serve to enforce code whitespace and other trivia).
We strongly recommend you use Prettier or an equivalent for formatting your code, not ESLint formatting rules.
See [What About Formatting? > Suggested Usage](./troubleshooting/formatting#suggested-usage).
