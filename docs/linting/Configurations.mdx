[ESLint shareable configurations](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/developer-guide/shareable-configs) exist to provide a comprehensive list of rules settings that you can start with.
`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` includes built-in configurations you can extend from to pull in the recommended starting rules.

> With the exception of `all`, `strict`, and `strict-type-checked`, all configurations are considered "stable".
> Rule additions and removals are treated as breaking changes and will only be done in major version bumps.

## Getting Started

### Projects Without Type Checking

If your project does not enable [typed linting](./Typed_Linting.mdx), we suggest enabling the [`recommended`](#recommended) and [`stylistic`](#stylistic) configurations to start:

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic',
  ],
};
```

> If a majority of developers working on your project are comfortable with TypeScript and typescript-eslint, consider replacing `recommended` with `strict`.

### Projects With Type Checking

If your project enables [typed linting](./Typed_Linting.mdx), we suggest enabling the [`recommended-type-checked`](#recommended-type-checked) and [`stylistic-type-checked`](#stylistic-type-checked) configurations to start:

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked',
  ],
};
```

> If a majority of developers working on your project are comfortable with TypeScript and typescript-eslint, consider replacing `recommended-type-checked` with `strict-type-checked`.

## Recommended Configurations

We recommend that most projects should extend from one of:

- [`recommended`](#recommended): Recommended rules for code correctness that you can drop in without additional configuration.
- [`recommended-type-checked`](#recommended-type-checked): Additional recommended rules that require type information.
- [`strict`](#strict): Additional strict rules that can also catch bugs but are more opinionated than recommended rules.
- [`strict-type-checked`](#strict-type-checked): Additional strict rules require type information.

Additionally, we provide a [`stylistic`](#stylistic) config that enforces concise and consistent code.
We recommend that most projects should extend from either:

- [`stylistic`](#stylistic): Stylistic rules you can drop in without additional configuration.
- [`stylistic-type-checked`](#stylistic-type-checked): Additional stylistic rules that require type information.

:::note
These configurations are our recommended starting points, but **you don't need to use them as-is**.
ESLint allows configuring own rule settings on top of extended configurations.
See [ESLint's Configuring Rules docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/rules#using-configuration-files).
:::

### `recommended`

Recommended rules for code correctness that you can drop in without additional configuration.
These rules are those whose reports are almost always for a bad practice and/or likely bug.
`recommended` also disables core ESLint rules known to conflict with typescript-eslint rules or cause issues in TypeScript codebases.

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'],
};
```

See [`configs/recommended.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/recommended.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

### `recommended-type-checked`

Contains all of `recommended` along with additional recommended rules that require type information.
Rules newly added in this configuration are similarly useful to those in `recommended`.

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked'],
};
```

See [`configs/recommended-type-checked.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/recommended-type-checked.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

### `strict`

Contains all of `recommended`, as well as additional strict rules that can also catch bugs.
Rules added in `strict` are more opinionated than recommended rules and might not apply to all projects.

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict'],
};
```

See [`configs/strict.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/strict.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

:::caution
We recommend a TypeScript project extend from `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict` only if a nontrivial percentage of its developers are highly proficient in TypeScript.
:::

### `strict-type-checked`

Contains all of `recommended`, `recommended-type-checked`, and `strict`, along with additional strict rules that require type information.
Rules newly added in this configuration are similarly useful (and opinionated) to those in `strict`.

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked'],
};
```

See [`configs/strict-type-checked.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/strict-type-checked.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

:::caution
We recommend a TypeScript project extend from `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked` only if a nontrivial percentage of its developers are highly proficient in TypeScript.
:::

### `stylistic`

Rules considered to be best practice for modern TypeScript codebases, but that do not impact program logic.
These rules are generally opinionated about enforcing simpler code patterns.

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic'],
};
```

See [`configs/stylistic.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/stylistic.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

### `stylistic-type-checked`

Contains all of `stylistic`, along with additional stylistic rules that require type information.
Rules newly added in this configuration are similarly opinionated to those in `stylistic`.

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked'],
};
```

See [`configs/stylistic-type-checked.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/stylistic-type-checked.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

## Other Configurations

typescript-eslint includes a few utility configurations.

### `all`

Enables each the rules provided as a part of typescript-eslint.
Note that many rules are not applicable in all codebases, or are meant to be configured.

See [`configs/all.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/all.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

:::warning
We do not recommend TypeScript projects extend from `plugin:@typescript-eslint/all`.
Many rules conflict with each other and/or are intended to be configured per-project.
:::

### `base`

A minimal ruleset that sets only the required parser and plugin options needed to run typescript-eslint.
We don't recommend using this directly; instead, extend from an earlier recommended rule.

This config is automatically included if you use any of the recommended configurations.

See [`configs/base.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/base.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

### `disable-type-checked`

A utility ruleset that will disable type-aware linting and all type-aware rules available in our project.
This config is useful if you'd like to have your base config concerned with type-aware linting, and then conditionally use [overrides](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuration-based-on-glob-patterns) to disable type-aware linting on specific subsets of your codebase.

See [`configs/disable-type-checked.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/disable-type-checked.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

:::info
If you use type-aware rules from other plugins, you will need to manually disable these rules or use a premade config they provide to disable them.
:::

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',
  ],
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['*.js'],
      extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/disable-type-checked'],
    },
  ],
};
```

### `eslint-recommended`

This ruleset is meant to be used after extending `eslint:recommended`.
It disables core ESLint rules that are already checked by the TypeScript compiler.
Additionally, it enables rules that promote using the more modern constructs TypeScript allows for.

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',
  ],
};
```

This config is automatically included if you use any of the recommended configurations.

See [`configs/eslint-recommended.ts`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v6/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/eslint-recommended.ts) for the exact contents of this config.

## Suggesting Configuration Changes

If you feel strongly that a specific rule should (or should not) be one of these configurations, please [file an issue](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/new?assignees=&labels=package%3A+eslint-plugin%2Cpreset+config+change%2Ctriage&template=09-config-change.yaml&title=Configs%3A+%3Ca+short+description+of+my+proposal%3E) along with a **detailed** argument explaining your reasoning.

## Formatting

None of the preset configs provided by typescript-eslint enable formatting rules (rules that only serve to enforce code whitespace and other trivia).
We strongly recommend you use Prettier or an equivalent for formatting your code, not ESLint formatting rules.
See [What About Formatting? > Suggested Usage](./troubleshooting/formatting#suggested-usage).
