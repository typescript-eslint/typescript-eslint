## I am using a rule from ESLint core, and it doesn't work correctly with TypeScript code

This happens because TypeScript adds new features that ESLint doesn't know about.

The first step is to <u>[check our list of "extension" rules here](/rules/#extension-rules)</u>.
An extension rule is a rule which extends the base ESLint rules to support TypeScript syntax.
If you find it in there, give it a go to see if it works for you.
You can configure it by disabling the base rule, and turning on the extension rule.
Here's an example with the `semi` rule:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "semi": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/semi": "error"
  }
}
```

If you don't find an existing extension rule, or the extension rule doesn't work for your case, then you can go ahead and check our issues.

## I get errors telling me "ESLint was configured to run ... However, that TSConfig does not / none of those TSConfigs include this file"

These errors are caused by an ESLint config requesting type information be generated for a file that isn't included in the TypeScript configuration.

### Fixing the Error

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

- If you **do not** want to lint the file:
  - Use <u>[one of the options ESLint offers](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/ignoring-code)</u> to ignore files, namely a `.eslintignore` file, or `ignorePatterns` config.
- If you **do** want to lint the file:
  - If you **do not** want to lint the file with <u>[type-aware linting](./Typed_Linting.mdx)</u>:
    - Use <u>[ESLint's `overrides` configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#configuration-based-on-glob-patterns)</u> to configure the file to not be parsed with type information:
      <details>
        <summary>
          A popular setup is to remove all rules requiring type information from the top-level configuration
          and only apply them to TypeScript files via an override.
        </summary>

        ```js title=".eslintrc.cjs"
        module.exports = {
          // ... the rest of your config ...
          overrides: [
            {
              extends: [
                'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking',
              ],
              files: ['./**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
            },
          ],
        };
        ```

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Alternatively, in our <a href="/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v6-beta">version v6</a>, you can use our{' '}
          <a href="https://v6--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/linting/configs#disable-type-checked"><code>disable-type-checked</code> config</a> to disable type checking for just that type of file.
        </summary>

        ```js title=".eslintrc.cjs"
        module.exports = {
          // ... the rest of your config ...
          overrides: [
            {
              extends: ['plugin:@typescript-eslint/disable-type-checked'],
              files: ['./**/*.js'],
            },
          ],
        };
        ```
        To disable type checking for files manually, set `parserOptions: { project: null }` to an override for the files you wish to exclude. Note that `{ project: undefined }` will not work, and you'll also need to disable any rules or rule options that require type checking.
      </details>

  - If you **do** want to lint the file with <u>[type-aware linting](./Typed_Linting.mdx)</u>:
    - Check the `include` option of each of the TSConfigs that you provide to `parserOptions.project` - you must ensure that all files match an `include` glob, or else our tooling will not be able to find it.
      - If the file is a `.cjs`, `.js`, or `.mjs` file, make sure <u>[`allowJs`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowJs)</u> is enabled.
    - If your file shouldn't be a part of one of your existing tsconfigs (for example, it is a script/tool local to the repo), then consider creating a new tsconfig (we advise calling it `tsconfig.eslint.json`) in your project root which lists this file in its `include`. For an example of this, you can check out the configuration we use in this repo:
      - <u>[`tsconfig.eslint.json`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/tsconfig.eslint.json)</u>
      - <u>[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/.eslintrc.js)</u>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### More Details

This error may appear from the combination of two things:

- The ESLint configuration for the source file specifies at least one TSConfig file in `parserOptions.project`
- None of those TSConfig files includes the source file being linted
  - Note that files with the same name and different extension may not be recognized by TypeScript: see <u>[`parserOptions.project` docs](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/main/packages/parser#parseroptionsproject)</u>

When TSConfig files are specified for parsing a source file, `@typescript-eslint/parser` will use the first TSConfig that is able to include that source file (per <u>[aka.ms/tsconfig#include](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include)</u>) to generate type information.
However, if no specified TSConfig includes the source file, the parser won't be able to generate type information.

This error most commonly happens on config files or similar that are not included in their project TSConfig(s).
For example, many projects have files like:

- An `.eslintrc.cjs` with `parserOptions.project: ["./tsconfig.json"]`
- A `tsconfig.json` with `include: ["src"]`

In that case, viewing the `.eslintrc.cjs` in an IDE with the ESLint extension will show the error notice that the file couldn't be linted because it isn't included in `tsconfig.json`.

See our docs on <u>[type aware linting](./Typed_Linting.mdx)</u> for more information.

## I get errors telling me "The file must be included in at least one of the projects provided"

You're using an outdated version of `@typescript-eslint/parser`.
Update to the latest version to see a more informative version of this error message, explained [above](#i-get-errors-telling-me-eslint-was-configured-to-run--however-that-tsconfig-does-not--none-of-those-tsconfigs-include-this-file 'backlink to I get errors telling me ESLint was configured to run ...').

## How do I turn on a `@typescript-eslint` rule?

First make sure you've read the docs and understand ESLint configuration files:

- <u>[Read our getting started guide](../Getting_Started.mdx)</u> to ensure your
  config is properly setup to start configuring our rules.
- <u>
    [Checkout ESLint's documentation on configuring
    rules](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules)
  </u> to ensure you understand how to configure rules.

Our <u>[rule docs](/rules)</u> detail the options each rule supports under the "Options" heading.
We use TypeScript types to describe an `Options` tuple type for the rule which you can use to configure the a rule.
In your config file the keys of the `rules` object are the names of the rules you wish to configure and the values follow the following form:

```ts
type Severity = 'off' | 'warn' | 'error';
type RuleConfig =
  | Severity
  | [Severity]
  | [
      Severity,
      // Options is the tuple type from the rule docs
      ...Options,
    ];
```

Some examples

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    // turns a rule on with no configuration (i.e. uses the default configuration)
    '@typescript-eslint/array-type': 'error',
    // turns on a rule with configuration
    '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': ['warn', { ignoreRestArgs: true }],
  },
};
```

## typescript-eslint thinks my variable is never nullish / is `any` / etc., but that is clearly not the case to me

Our type-aware rules almost always trust the type information provided by the TypeScript compiler. Therefore, an easy way to check if our rule is behaving correctly is to inspect the type of the variable in question, such as by hovering over it in your IDE.

If the IDE also shows that the type is never nullish / is `any`, you need to fix the type. A very common case is with the <u>[`no-unnecessary-condition`](/rules/no-unnecessary-condition)</u> rule. Take this code for example:

```ts
let condition = false;

const f = () => (condition = true);
f();

if (condition) {
  //^^^^^^^^^ Unnecessary conditional, value is always falsy.
}
```

You can see that the type of `condition` is actually the literal type `false` by hovering over it in your IDE. In this case, typescript-eslint cannot possible know better than TypeScript itself, so you need to fix the report by fixing the type, such as through an assertion (`let condition = false as boolean`).

If the IDE provides different type information from typescript-eslint's report, then make sure that the TypeScript setup used for your IDE, typescript-eslint, and `tsc` are the same: the same TypeScript version, the same type-checking compiler options, and the same files being included in the project. For example, if a type is declared in another file but that file is not included, the type will become `any`, and cause our `no-unsafe-*` rules to report.

## I use a framework (like Vue) that requires custom file extensions, and I get errors like "You should add `parserOptions.extraFileExtensions` to your config"

You can use `parserOptions.extraFileExtensions` to specify an array of non-TypeScript extensions to allow, for example:

```js title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  parserOptions: {
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
    project: ['./tsconfig.json'],
    // Add this line
    extraFileExtensions: ['.vue'],
  },
};
```

## I am running into errors when parsing TypeScript in my .vue files

If you are running into issues parsing .vue files, it might be because parsers like <u>[`vue-eslint-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-eslint-parser)</u> are required to parse `.vue` files. In this case you can move `@typescript-eslint/parser` inside `parserOptions` and use `vue-eslint-parser` as the top level parser.

```diff
- "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
+ "parser": "vue-eslint-parser",
  "parserOptions": {
+     "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
      "sourceType": "module"
  }
```

The `parserOptions.parser` option can also specify an object to specify multiple parsers. See the <u>[`vue-eslint-parser` usage guide](https://eslint.vuejs.org/user-guide/#usage)</u> for more details.

## One of my lint rules isn't working correctly on a pure JavaScript file

This is to be expected - ESLint rules do not check file extensions on purpose, as it causes issues in environments that use non-standard extensions (for example, a `.vue` and a `.md` file can both contain TypeScript code to be linted).

If you have some pure JavaScript code that you do not want to apply certain lint rules to, then you can use <u>[ESLint's `overrides` configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-based-on-glob-patterns)</u> to turn off certain rules, or even change the parser based on glob patterns.

## Should I run ESLint on transpiled output JavaScript files?

No.

Source TypeScript files have all the content of output JavaScript files, plus type annotations.
There's no benefit to also linting output JavaScript files.

## TypeScript should be installed locally

Make sure that you have installed TypeScript locally i.e. by using `npm install typescript`, not `npm install -g typescript`,
or by using `yarn add typescript`, not `yarn global add typescript`.
See <u>[#2041](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/2041)</u> for more information.

## How can I ban `<specific language feature>`?

ESLint core contains the rule <u>[`no-restricted-syntax`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-syntax)</u>.
This generic rule allows you to specify a <u>[selector](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/selectors)</u> for the code you want to ban, along with a custom error message.

You can use an AST visualization tool such as <u>[typescript-eslint playground](/play#showAST=es)</u> > _Options_ > _AST Explorer_ on its left sidebar by selecting _ESTree_ to help in figuring out the structure of the AST that you want to ban.

For example, you can ban enums (or some variation of) using one of the following configs:

```jsonc
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-syntax": [
      "error",
      // ban all enums
      {
        "selector": "TSEnumDeclaration",
        "message": "My reason for not using any enums at all"
      },

      // ban just const enums
      {
        "selector": "TSEnumDeclaration[const=true]",
        "message": "My reason for not using const enums"
      },

      // ban just non-const enums
      {
        "selector": "TSEnumDeclaration:not([const=true])",
        "message": "My reason for not using non-const enums"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Why don't I see TypeScript errors in my ESLint output?

TypeScript's compiler (or whatever your build chain may be) is specifically designed and built to validate the correctness of your codebase.
Our tooling does not reproduce the errors that TypeScript provides, because doing so would slow down the lint run [1], and duplicate the errors that TypeScript already outputs for you.

Instead, our tooling exists to **_augment_** TypeScript's built in checks with lint rules that consume the type information in new ways beyond just verifying the runtime correctness of your code.

[1] - TypeScript computes type information lazily, so us asking for the errors it would produce from the compiler would take an _additional_ ~100ms per file.
This doesn't sound like a lot, but depending on the size of your codebase, it can easily add up to between several seconds to several minutes to a lint run.

## I get errors from the `no-undef` rule about global variables not being defined, even though there are no TypeScript errors

The `no-undef` lint rule does not use TypeScript to determine the global variables that exist - instead, it relies upon ESLint's configuration.

We strongly recommend that you do not use the `no-undef` lint rule on TypeScript projects.
The checks it provides are already provided by TypeScript without the need for configuration - TypeScript just does this significantly better.

As of our v4.0.0 release, this also applies to types.
If you use global types from a 3rd party package (i.e. anything from an `@types` package), then you will have to configure ESLint appropriately to define these global types.
For example; the `JSX` namespace from `@types/react` is a global 3rd party type that you must define in your ESLint config.

Note, that for a mixed project including JavaScript and TypeScript, the `no-undef` rule (like any rule) can be turned off for TypeScript files alone by adding an `overrides` section to `.eslintrc.cjs`:

```js title=".eslintrc.cjs"
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of your config ...
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['*.ts', '*.mts', '*.cts', '*.tsx'],
      rules: {
        'no-undef': 'off',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

If you choose to leave on the ESLint `no-undef` lint rule, you can <u>[manually define the set of allowed `globals` in your ESLint config](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-globals)</u>, and/or you can use one of the <u>[pre-defined environment (`env`) configurations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-environments)</u>.

## How do I check to see what versions are installed?

If you have multiple versions of our tooling, it can cause various bugs for you.
This is because ESLint may load a different version each run depending on how you run it - leading to inconsistent lint results.

Installing our tooling in the root of your project does not mean that only one version is installed.
One or more of your dependencies may have its own dependency on our tooling, meaning `npm`/`yarn` will additionally install that version for use by that package.
For example, `react-scripts` (part of `create-react-app`) has a dependency on our tooling.

You can check what versions are installed in your project using the following commands:

```bash npm2yarn
npm list @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
```

If you see more than one version installed, then you will have to either use <u>[yarn resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions)</u> to force a single version, or you will have to downgrade your root versions to match the dependency versions.

**The best course of action in this case is to wait until your dependency releases a new version with support for our latest versions.**

## How can I specify a TypeScript version / `parserOptions.typescriptLocation`?

You can't, and you don't want to.

You should use the same version of TypeScript for linting as the rest of your project.
TypeScript versions often have slight differences in edge cases that can cause contradictory information between typescript-eslint rules and editor information.
For example:

- `@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions` might be operating with TypeScript version _X_ and think a variable is `string[] | undefined`
- TypeScript itself might be on version _X+1-beta_ and think the variable is `string[]`

See <u>[this issue comment](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/4102#issuecomment-963265514)</u> for more details.

## Changes to one file are not reflected when linting other files in my IDE

> tl;dr: Restart your ESLint server to force an update.

ESLint currently does not have any way of telling parsers such as ours when an arbitrary file is changed on disk.
That means if you change file A that is imported by file B, it won't update lint caches for file B -- even if file B's text contents have changed.
Sometimes the only solution is to restart your ESLint editor extension altogether.

See <u>[this issue comment](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/5845#issuecomment-1283248238 'GitHub issue 5845, comment 1283248238: details on ESLint cross-file caching')</u> for more information.

### I get `no-unsafe-*` complaints for cross-file changes

See [Changes to one file are not reflected in linting other files in my IDE](#changes-to-one-file-are-not-reflected-when-linting-other-files-in-my-ide).
Rules such as <u>[`no-unsafe-argument`](/rules/no-unsafe-argument)</u>, <u>[`no-unsafe-assignment`](/rules/no-unsafe-assignment)</u>, and <u>[`no-unsafe-call`](/rules/no-unsafe-call)</u> are often impacted.

## "The '`<key>`' property is deprecated on '`<type>`' nodes. Use '`<key>`' instead." warnings

If you're seeing this warning, it's likely you're using an ESLint plugin (or other tooling) that hasn't been updated for typescript-eslint v6.
Make sure you're using the latest versions of each of your ESLint plugins (and other tooling).

If you've using many ESLint plugins, have updated each to their latest version, and you're not sure which one this complaint is coming from, try either or both of:

- Running with <u>[`--trace-deprecation`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--trace-deprecation)</u> (e.g. `npx cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--trace-deprecation npm run lint`)
- Disabling half of them at a time to narrow down which plugin it is

Then make sure each of those plugins has a GitHub issue asking that they release a version supporting typescript-eslint v6.

:::tip
For developers updating ESLint rules in plugins that still need to support typescript-eslint v5: you may need to `||` fall back to the old property key if the new one doesn't exist:

```diff
- node.typeParameters
+ node.typeArguments || node.typeParameters
```
