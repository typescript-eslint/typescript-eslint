Thank you for your interest in contributing to typescript-eslint! ðŸ’œ

Although typescript-eslint's packages are already downloaded millions of times per month and power high profile projects across our industry, this is a 100% community-driven project.
From the second you install one of the packages from this monorepo, you are a part of that community.
So, from the bottom of our hearts, _thank you_ ðŸ’•.
