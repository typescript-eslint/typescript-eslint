# `scope-manager` `eslint-scope` Tests

These tests are taken from the [`eslint-scope`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope) package.
The intention is to help us ensure we do not regress functionality compared to the original package.

They have been modified to:

- be written in TypeScript
- work with jest
- work with our folder structure
- adhere to our formatting and linting style

[The code was forked from `dbddf14d5771b21b5da704213e4508c660ca1c64`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/blob/dbddf14d5771b21b5da704213e4508c660ca1c64/tests/).
