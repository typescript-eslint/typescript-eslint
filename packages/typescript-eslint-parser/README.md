# TypeScript ESLint Parser (Experimental)

A parser that converts TypeScript into an [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compatible form so it can be used in ESLint.

**Important:** This parser is not fully compatible with all ESLint rules and plugins. Some rules will improperly mark source code as failing or not find problems where it should.

## Supported TypeScript Version

We will always endeavor to support the latest stable version of TypeScript.

The version of TypeScript currently supported by this parser is `~2.6.1`. This is reflected in the `devDependency` requirement within the package.json file, and it is what the tests will be run against. We have an open `peerDependency` requirement in order to allow for experimentation on newer/beta versions of TypeScript.

If you use a non-supported version of TypeScript, the parser will log a warning to the console.

**Please ensure that you are using a supported version before submitting any issues/bug reports.**

## Known Issues

The following ESLint rules will fail on acceptable code:
 - no-undef [#77](https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser/issues/77)
 - no-unused-vars [#77](https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser/issues/77)
 - no-useless-constructor [#77](https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser/issues/77)
 - space-infix-ops [#224](https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser/issues/224)
 
The follow ESLint plugins have issues when used with this parser:
 - eslint-plugin-react [#213](https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser/issues/213)
 - eslint-plugin-import
    - prefer-default-export - Will fail exports inside of Namespaces or Modules
  
The following TypeScript syntax will cause rules to fail or ESLint v3 to crash:
 - Empty body functions
   - Abstract methods
   - Function overloading
   - Declared functions

## Usage

Install:

```
npm i typescript-eslint-parser --save-dev
```

And in your ESLint configuration file:

```
"parser": "typescript-eslint-parser"
```
