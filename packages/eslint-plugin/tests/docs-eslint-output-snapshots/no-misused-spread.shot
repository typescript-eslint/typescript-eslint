declare const promise: Promise<number>;
const spreadPromise = { ...promise };
                        ~~~~~~~~~~ Using the spread operator on Promise in an object can cause unexpected behavior. Did you forget to await the promise?

declare function getObject(): Record<string, strings>;
const getObjectSpread = { ...getObject };
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Using the spread operator on a function without additional properties can cause unexpected behavior. Did you forget to call the function?

declare const map: Map<string, number>;
const mapSpread = { ...map };
                    ~~~~~~ Using the spread operator on a Map in an object will result in an empty object. Did you mean to use `Object.fromEntries(map)` instead?

declare const userName: string;
const characters = [...userName];
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~ Using the spread operator on a string can mishandle special characters, as can `.split("")`.
                                - `...` produces Unicode code points, which will decompose complex emojis into individual emojis
                                - .split("") produces UTF-16 code units, which breaks rich characters in many languages
                                Consider using `Intl.Segmenter` for locale-aware string decomposition.
                                Otherwise, if you don't need to preserve emojis or other non-Ascii characters, disable this lint rule on this line or configure the 'allow' rule option.

declare class Box {
  value: number;
}
const boxSpread = { ...Box };
                    ~~~~~~ Using the spread operator on class declarations will spread only their static properties, and will lose their class prototype.

declare const instance: Box;
const instanceSpread = { ...instance };
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~ Using the spread operator on class instances will lose their class prototype.
