Incorrect

declare class C {
  new(): C;
  ~~~~~~~~~ Class cannot have method named `new`.
}

interface I {
  new (): I;
  ~~~~~~~~~~ Interfaces cannot be constructed, only classes.
  constructor(): void;
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Interfaces cannot be constructed, only classes.
}

Correct

declare class C {
  constructor();
}

interface I {
  new (): C;
}
