Incorrect

let bar: 2 = 2;
         ~ Expected a `const` assertion instead of a literal type annotation.
let foo = <'bar'>'bar';
           ~~~~~ Expected a `const` instead of a literal type assertion.
let foo = { bar: 'baz' as 'baz' };
                          ~~~~~ Expected a `const` instead of a literal type assertion.

Correct

let foo = 'bar';
let foo = 'bar' as const;
let foo: 'bar' = 'bar' as const;
let bar = 'bar' as string;
let foo = <string>'bar';
let foo = { bar: 'baz' };
