Correct

const arr: string[] = [];
const items: number[] = [];
let data: boolean[] = [];
var list: any[] = [];

// If you intentionally want never[], you can be explicit about it
// Placeholder that will be replaced later
const placeholder: never[] = [];

// Non-empty arrays don't require explicit types
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const strings = ['a', 'b'];

// Type assertions are also acceptable
const typedArr = [] as string[];
const typedItems = [] as number[];
