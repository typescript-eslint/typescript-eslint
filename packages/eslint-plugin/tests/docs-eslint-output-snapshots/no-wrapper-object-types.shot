let myBigInt: BigInt;
              ~~~~~~ Prefer using the primitive `bigint` as a type name, rather than the upper-cased `BigInt`.
let myBoolean: Boolean;
               ~~~~~~~ Prefer using the primitive `boolean` as a type name, rather than the upper-cased `Boolean`.
let myNumber: Number;
              ~~~~~~ Prefer using the primitive `number` as a type name, rather than the upper-cased `Number`.
let myString: String;
              ~~~~~~ Prefer using the primitive `string` as a type name, rather than the upper-cased `String`.
let mySymbol: Symbol;
              ~~~~~~ Prefer using the primitive `symbol` as a type name, rather than the upper-cased `Symbol`.

let myObject: Object = 'allowed by TypeScript';
              ~~~~~~ Prefer using the primitive `object` as a type name, rather than the upper-cased `Object`.

Correct

let myBigint: bigint;
let myBoolean: boolean;
let myNumber: number;
let myString: string;
let mySymbol: symbol;

let myObject: object = "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'object'.";
