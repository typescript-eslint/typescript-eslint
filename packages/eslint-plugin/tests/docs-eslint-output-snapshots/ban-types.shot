"Incorrect

// use lower-case primitives for consistency
const str: String = 'foo';
           ~~~~~~ Don't use \`String\` as a type. Use string instead
const bool: Boolean = true;
            ~~~~~~~ Don't use \`Boolean\` as a type. Use boolean instead
const num: Number = 1;
           ~~~~~~ Don't use \`Number\` as a type. Use number instead
const symb: Symbol = Symbol('foo');
            ~~~~~~ Don't use \`Symbol\` as a type. Use symbol instead
const bigInt: BigInt = 1n;
              ~~~~~~ Don't use \`BigInt\` as a type. Use bigint instead

// use a proper function type
const func: Function = () => 1;
            ~~~~~~~~ Don't use \`Function\` as a type. The \`Function\` type accepts any function-like value.
                     It provides no type safety when calling the function, which can be a common source of bugs.
                     It also accepts things like class declarations, which will throw at runtime as they will not be called with \`new\`.
                     If you are expecting the function to accept certain arguments, you should explicitly define the function shape.

// use safer object types
const lowerObj: Object = {};
                ~~~~~~ Don't use \`Object\` as a type. The \`Object\` type actually means "any non-nullish value", so it is marginally better than \`unknown\`.
                       - If you want a type meaning "any object", you probably want \`object\` instead.
                       - If you want a type meaning "any value", you probably want \`unknown\` instead.
                       - If you really want a type meaning "any non-nullish value", you probably want \`NonNullable<unknown>\` instead.
const capitalObj: Object = { a: 'string' };

const curly1: {} = 1;
              ~~ Don't use \`{}\` as a type. \`{}\` actually means "any non-nullish value".

                 - If you want a type meaning "empty object", you probably want \`Record<string, never>\` instead.
                 - If you really want a type meaning "any non-nullish value", you probably want \`NonNullable<unknown>\` instead.
