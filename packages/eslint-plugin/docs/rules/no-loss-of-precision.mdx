:::danger Deprecated

This rule has been deprecated because the base [`eslint/no-loss-of-precision`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-loss-of-precision) rule added support for [numeric separators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-numeric-separator).
There is no longer any need to use this extension rule.
