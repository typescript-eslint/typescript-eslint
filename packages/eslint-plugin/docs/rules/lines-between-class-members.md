This rule improves readability by enforcing lines between class members. It will not check empty lines before the first member and after the last member. This rule will require or disallow an empty line between class members.

## Examples

This rule extends the base [`eslint/lines-between-class-members`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/lines-between-class-members) rule.
It adds support for ignoring overload methods in a class.

## Options

In addition to the options supported by the `lines-between-class-members` rule in ESLint core, the rule adds the following options:

- Object option:

  - `"exceptAfterOverload": true` (default) - Skip checking empty lines after overload class members
  - `"exceptAfterOverload": false` - **do not** skip checking empty lines after overload class members

- [See the other options allowed](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/main/docs/rules/lines-between-class-members.md#options)

### `exceptAfterOverload: true`

Examples of **correct** code for the `{ "exceptAfterOverload": true }` option:

```ts
/*eslint @typescript-eslint/lines-between-class-members: ["error", "always", { "exceptAfterOverload": true }]*/

class foo {
  bar(a: string): void;
  bar(a: string, b: string): void;
  bar(a: string, b: string) {}

  baz() {}

  qux() {}
}
```

### `exceptAfterOverload: false`

Examples of **correct** code for the `{ "exceptAfterOverload": false }` option:

```ts
/*eslint @typescript-eslint/lines-between-class-members: ["error", "always", { "exceptAfterOverload": false }]*/

class foo {
  bar(a: string): void;

  bar(a: string, b: string): void;

  bar(a: string, b: string) {}

  baz() {}

  qux() {}
}
```
