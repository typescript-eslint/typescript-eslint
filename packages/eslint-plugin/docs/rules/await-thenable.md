# Disallows awaiting a value that is not a Promise (`await-thenable`)

This rule disallows awaiting a value that is not a "Thenable" (an object which has `then` method, such as a Promise).
While it is valid JavaScript to await a non-`Promise`-like value (it will resolve immediately), this pattern is often a programmer error, such as forgetting to add parenthesis to call a function that returns a Promise.

## Rule Details

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
await 'value';

const createValue = () => 'value';
await createValue();
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
await Promise.resolve('value');

const createValue = async () => 'value';
await createValue();
```

## When Not To Use It

If you want to allow code to `await` non-Promise values.
This is generally not preferred, but can sometimes be useful for visual consistency.
