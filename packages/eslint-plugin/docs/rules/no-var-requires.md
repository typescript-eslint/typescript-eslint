In other words, the use of forms such as `var foo = require("foo")` are banned. Instead use ES6 style imports or `import foo = require("foo")` imports.

## Examples

<!--tabs-->

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
var foo = require('foo');
const foo = require('foo');
let foo = require('foo');
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
import foo = require('foo');
require('foo');
import foo from 'foo';
```

## Options

### `allowPackageJson`

When this is set to `true`, the rule will allow `require` variables that import `package.json` files. This is because `package.json` commonly lives outside of the TS root directory, so statically importing it would lead to root directory conflicts, especially with `resolveJsonModule` enabled.

With `{allowPackageJson: true}`:

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
const foo = require('../data.json');
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
const foo = require('../package.json');
```

## When Not To Use It

If your project frequently uses older CommonJS `require`s, then this rule might not be applicable to you.
If only a subset of your project uses `require`s then you might consider using [ESLint disable comments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) for those specific situations instead of completely disabling this rule.
