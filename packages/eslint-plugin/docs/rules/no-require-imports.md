Prefer the newer ES6-style imports over `require()`.

## Examples

<!--tabs-->

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
const lib1 = require('lib1');
const { lib2 } = require('lib2');
import lib3 = require('lib3');
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
import * as lib1 from 'lib1';
import { lib2 } from 'lib2';
import * as lib3 from 'lib3';
```

## Options

### `allow`

An array of strings. These strings will be compiled into regular expressions with the `u` flag and be used to test against the imported path. A common use case is to allow importing `package.json`. This is because `package.json` commonly lives outside of the TS root directory, so statically importing it would lead to root directory conflicts, especially with `resolveJsonModule` enabled. You can also use it to allow importing any JSON if your environment doesn't support JSON modules, or use it for other cases where `import` statements cannot work.

With `{allow: ['/package\\.json$']}`:

<!--tabs-->

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
console.log(require('../data.json').version);
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
console.log(require('../package.json').version);
```

### `allowAsImport`

A boolean. If it's set to `true`, the require statements with an `import` declaration won't be reported. The default value is `false`. If you want to apply the `no-var-requires` rule, then set it to `true`.

With `{allowAsImport: true}`:

<!--tabs-->

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
var foo = require('foo');
const foo = require('foo');
let foo = require('foo');
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
import foo = require('foo');
require('foo');
import foo from 'foo';
```

## When Not To Use It

If your project frequently uses older CommonJS `require`s, then this rule might not be applicable to you.
If only a subset of your project uses `require`s then you might consider using [ESLint disable comments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) for those specific situations instead of completely disabling this rule.
