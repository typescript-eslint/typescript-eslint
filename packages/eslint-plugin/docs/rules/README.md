`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` includes over 100 rules that detect best practice violations, bugs, and/or stylistic issues specifically for TypeScript code. All of our rules are listed below.

:::tip
Instead of enabling rules one by one, we recommend using one of [our pre-defined configs](/linting/configs) to enable a large set of recommended rules.

## Rules

The rules are listed in alphabetical order. You can optionally filter them based on these categories:

import RulesTable from "@site/src/components/RulesTable";

<RulesTable />

## Filtering

### Config Group (⚙️)

"Config Group" refers to the [pre-defined config](/linting/configs) that includes the rule. Extending from a configuration preset allow for enabling a large set of recommended rules all at once.

### Metadata

- `🔧 fixable` refers to whether the rule contains an [ESLint `--fix` auto-fixer](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#--fix).
- `💡 has suggestions` refers to whether the rule contains an ESLint suggestion fixer.
  - Sometimes, it is not safe to automatically fix the code with an auto-fixer. But in these cases, we often have a good guess of what the correct fix should be, and we can provide it as a suggestion to the developer.
- `💭 requires type information` refers to whether the rule requires [typed linting](/linting/typed-linting).
- `🧱 extension rule` means that the rule was originally a [core ESLint rule](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/).
  - Some core ESLint rules do not support TypeScript syntax: either they crash, ignore the syntax, or falsely report against it.
  - In these cases, we create an "extension rule": a rule within our plugin that has the same functionality, but also supports TypeScript.
- `📐 formatting rule` means that the rule has to do with formatting.
  - We [strongly recommend against using ESLint for formatting](/linting/troubleshooting/formatting).
  - Soon, formatting rules will be moved to the [ESLint stylistic plugin](https://eslint.style).
- `💀 deprecated rule` means that the rule should no longer be used and will be removed from the plugin in a future version.
