When working with union types in TypeScript, it's common to want to write a `switch` statement intended to contain a `case` for each constituent (possible type in the union).
However, if the union type changes, it's easy to forget to modify the cases to account for any new types.

This rule reports when a `switch` statement over a value typed as a union of literals is missing a case for any of those literal types and does not have a `default` clause.

## Examples

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
}
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
  case 'Tuesday':
    result = 2;
    break;
  case 'Wednesday':
    result = 3;
    break;
  case 'Thursday':
    result = 4;
    break;
  case 'Friday':
    result = 5;
    break;
  case 'Saturday':
    result = 6;
    break;
  case 'Sunday':
    result = 7;
    break;
}
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

const day = 'Monday' as Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
  default:
    result = 42;
}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't frequently `switch` over union types with many parts, or intentionally wish to leave out some parts.
