This rule extends the base [`eslint/class-methods-use-this`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/class-methods-use-this) rule.
It adds support for ignoring `override` methods or methods on classes that implement an interface.

## Options

This rule adds the following options:

```ts
interface Options extends BaseClassMethodsUseThisOptions {
  ignoreOverrideMethods?: boolean;
  ignoreClassesThatImplementAnInterface?: boolean;
}

const defaultOptions: Options = {
  ...baseClassMethodsUseThisOptions,
  ignoreOverrideMethods: false,
  ignoreClassesThatImplementAnInterface: false,
};
```

### `ignoreOverrideMethods`

Makes the rule to ignores any class member explicitly marked with `override`.

Example of a correct code when `ignoreOverrideMethods` is set to `true`:

```ts option='{ "ignoreOverrideMethods": true }' showPlaygroundButton
class X {
  override method() {}
  override property = () => {};
}
```

### `ignoreClassesThatImplementAnInterface`

Makes the rule ignore all class members that are defined within a class that `implements` a type.

It's important to note that this option does not only apply to members defined in the interface as that would require type information.

Example of a correct code when `ignoreClassesThatImplementAnInterface` is set to `true`:

```ts option='{ "ignoreClassesThatImplementAnInterface": true }' showPlaygroundButton
class X implements Y {
  method() {}
  property = () => {};
}
```
