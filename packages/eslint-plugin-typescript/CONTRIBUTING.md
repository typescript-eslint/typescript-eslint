## Commenting and Discussing

***Don't be a douche.***
Consider the following when commenting:

- Everyone is a human (except for the bots).
- Everyone is freely providing their time for this project.
- Everyone wants to build the best tool.

## PR Requirements

For a PR to be merged, you must pass the following checks:

- there must be no lint errors - `yarn lint`
- the code must be formatted - `yarn format`
- your documentation must be up to date - `yarn docs-check`
- all tests must pass - `yarn test`

There is a commit hook which will help you follow this.
Travis will also automatically run these checks when you submit your PR (and will block us merging until you fix it).

## Adding/Changing a rule

When adding or changing a rule, you must:

- Ensure your feature / bug has an issue behind it.
  - This just makes it easier for people to find information in future, because PRs aren't included in the default issue search.
- Ensure your changes are covered by tests.
  - There's no hard and fast rule for how much testing is required, but try to cover as many bases as you can.
- Ensure your changes are documented in the `docs` folder. We're working to standardise how we document rules, but your docs should:
  - describe what the rule does, and why you might enable it.
  - (if any) outline the settings; how to configure them and what each one does
  - have clear examples of valid and invalid code when using the rule. Bonus points for extra cases showing what each setting does.

When adding a rule, you must also add a link to the rule in the README.md.

## Submitting Issues

- If your issue relates to a rule, start your title with the rule name:
  - `[no-unused-vars] False positive when fooing the bar`
- Search for the issue before you ask; we try hard to ensure it's easy to find existing issues.
- Follow the template.
  - We've built it to reduce the chance of us going back to ask you for things.
  - Don't be lazy and skip parts of it; we'll just ask you for that information anyway, so it'll only delay the process.
