# Enforces the use of `as Type` assertions instead of `<Type>` assertions.

TypeScript disallows the use of `<Type>` assertions in `.tsx` because of the similarity with  
JSX's syntax, which makes it impossible to parse. 

## Rule Details

This rule aims to standardise the use of type assertion style across the codebase

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```ts
const foo = <Foo>bar;
```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```ts
const foo = bar as Foo;
```

## When Not To Use It

If your codebase does not include `.tsx` files, then you will not need this rule.
