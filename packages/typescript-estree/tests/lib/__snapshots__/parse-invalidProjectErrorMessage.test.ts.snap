"ESLint was configured to run on \`<tsconfigRootDir>/ts/notIncluded0j1.ts\` using \`parserOptions.project\`: 
- <tsconfigRootDir>/tsconfig.json
- <tsconfigRootDir>/tsconfig.extra.json
However, none of those TSConfigs include this file. Either:
- Change ESLint's list of included files to not include this file
- Change one of those TSConfigs to include this file
- Create a new TSConfig that includes this file and include it in your parserOptions.project
