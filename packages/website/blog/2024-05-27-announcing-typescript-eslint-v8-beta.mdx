import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

[typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io) is the tooling that enables standard JavaScript tools such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to support TypeScript code.
We've been working on a set of breaking changes and general features that we're excited to get in front of users soon.
And now, we're excited to say that typescript-eslint v8 is ready for public beta testing! 🎉

Our plan for typescript-eslint v8 is to:

1. Have users try out betas starting in May of 2024
2. Respond to user feedback for the next ~1-2 months
3. Release a stable version within the next ~1-2 months

Nothing mentioned in this blog post is set in stone.
If you feel passionately about any of the choices we've made here — positively or negatively — then do let us know on [the typescript-eslint Discord](https://discord.gg/FSxKq8Tdyg)'s `#v8` channel!

## Trying Out v8

Please do try out the typescript-eslint v8 beta!

### As A New User

If you don't yet use typescript-eslint, you can go through our [configuration steps on the v8 _Getting Started_ docs](https://v8--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/getting-started).
It'll walk you through setting up typescript-eslint in a project.

To use v8 specifically, see the following section for an updated install command.

### As An Existing User

If you already use typescript-eslint, you'll need to first replace your package's previous versions of `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` with `@rc-v8` versions:

<Tabs groupId="eslint-config">
<TabItem value="Flat Config">

```shell
npm i typescript-eslint@rc-v8 --save-dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Legacy Config">

```shell
npm i @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@rc-v8 @typescript-eslint/parser@rc-v8 --save-dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We highly recommend then basing your ESLint configuration on the reworked typescript-eslint [recommended configurations](/users/configs) — especially if it's been a while since you've reworked your linter config.

## User-Facing Changes

These are the changes that users of typescript-eslint —generally, any developer running ESLint on TypeScript code— should pay attention to when upgrading typescript-eslint from v7 to v8.

> ⏳ indicates a change that has been scheduled for v8 but not yet released.
> We'll update this blog post as the corresponding pull requests land.

### ESLint v9 Support

typescript-eslint v8 ships with full support for ESLint v9.

typescript-eslint v7 was our first version that supported ESLint's [new "flat" config file format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files), which was already available in ESLint v8.
ESLint v9 still supports ESLint's [older legacy config file format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-deprecated) so our tooling does as well.
However, ESLint v9 also includes a set of breaking changes that we added support for in typescript-eslint v8.
See the [ESLint v9 release blog post](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released) for more details.

### Project Service

The biggest new feature added in this version is the stability of our new "project service".
In short, the project service is a new way to enable [typed linting](/getting-started/typed-linting) that is generally _easier to configure_ and _faster at runtime_ than our previous offerings.
It's been experimentally available since v6.1.0 under the name `EXPERIMENTAL_useProjectService`; now, we've renamed it to `projectService`.

You can use the new project service in your configuration instead of the previous `parserOptions.project`:

```js title="eslint.config.js"
import eslint from '@eslint/js';
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';

export default tseslint.config(
  eslint.configs.recommended,
  ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
  {
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        // Remove this line
        project: true,
        // Add this line
        projectService: true,
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
    },
  },
);
```

The project service will automatically find the closest `tsconfig.json` for each file (like `project: true`).
It also allows enabling typed linting for files not explicitly included in a `tsconfig.json`.
This should remove the need for custom `tsconfig.eslint.json` files to lint files like `eslint.config.js`!

Typed linting for out-of-project files can be done by specifying two properties of a `parserOptions.projectService` object:

- `allowDefaultProject`: a glob of a small number of out-of-project files to enable a slower default project on
- `defaultProject`: path to a TypeScript configuration file to use for the slower default project

```js title="eslint.config.js"
import eslint from '@eslint/js';
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';

export default tseslint.config(
  eslint.configs.recommended,
  ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
  {
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        // Remove this line
        project: ['packages/*/tsconfig.json', 'tsconfig.eslint.json'],
        // Added lines start
        projectService: {
          allowDefaultProject: ['./*.js'],
          defaultProject: './tsconfig.json',
        },
        // Added lines end
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
    },
  },
);
```

Internally, the project service uses the same TypeScript APIs that editors such as VS Code use.
Doing so should make it harder to accidentally configure different type information for ESLint than what you see in day-to-day editing.

We're thrilled to have the project service option promoted to stable in v8.
We'll soon release a [dedicated `parserOptions` blog post](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8031) walking through the new option in more details.
🚀

### Updated Configuration Rules

Every new major version of typescript-eslint comes with changes to which rules are enabled in the preset configurations and with which options.
Because this release also includes a reworking of the configurations themselves, the list of changes is too large to put in this blog post.
Instead see the table in [Changes to configurations for 8.0.0](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/discussions/8914) for a full list of the changes.

Please do try out the new rule configurations presets and let us know in that discussion!

:::tip
If your ESLint configuration contains many `rules` configurations, we suggest the following strategy to start anew:

1. Remove all your rules configurations
2. Extend from the preset configs that make sense for you
3. Run ESLint on your project
4. In your ESLint configuration, turn off any rules creating errors that don't make sense for your project — with comments explaining why
5. In your ESLint configuration and/or with inline `eslint-disable` comments, turn off/downgrade to "warn" any rules creating too many errors for you to fix — with _"TODO"_ comments linking to tracking issues/tickets to re-enable them

:::

### Rule Breaking Changes

Several rules are changed in significant enough ways to be considered breaking changes:

- [Rules: Deprecate prefer-ts-expect-error in favor of ban-ts-comment](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8333)
  - If you have [`@typescript-eslint/prefer-ts-expect-error`](/rules/prefer-ts-expect-error) manually enabled, remove that, and instead either use a [recommended config](/users/configs) or manually enable [`@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`](/rules/ban-ts-comment)
- [chore(eslint-plugin): deprecate no-var-requires in favor of no-require-imports](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8334)
  - If you have [`@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires`](/rules/no-var-requires) manually enabled, remove that, and instead either use a [recommended config](/users/configs) or manually enable [`@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`](/rules/no-require-imports)
- [feat(eslint-plugin): remove deprecated no-throw-literal rule](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/9083)
  - If you have [`@typescript-eslint/no-throw-literal`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-throw-literal) manually enabled, remove that, and instead either use a [recommended config](/users/configs) or manually enable [`@typescript-eslint/only-throw-error`](/rules/only-throw-error)
- [feat(eslint-plugin): [no-useless-template-literals] rename to no-useless-template-expression (deprecate no-useless-template-literals)](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8821) and [fix: no-useless-template-expression -> no-unnecessary-template-expression](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/9174)
  - Find-and-replace text from `no-useless-template-literals` to `no-unnecessary-template-expression`
- [feat(eslint-plugin): deprecate no-loss-of-precision extension rule](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8832)
  - If you have [`@typescript-eslint/no-loss-of-precision`](/rules/no-loss-of-precision) manually enabled, replace it with the base rule `no-loss-of-precision`.
- [feat(eslint-plugin): remove formatting/layout rules](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8833)
  - If you're using any of the old deprecated formatting rules, see [eslint.style](https://eslint.style) for their new equivalents
- [feat(eslint-plugin): [prefer-nullish-coalescing] change ignoreConditionalTests default to true](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8872)
  - If you want to have the rule check conditional tests, set its [`ignoreConditionalTests` option](/rules/prefer-nullish-coalescing/#ignoreconditionaltests) to `false` in your ESLint config
- [feat(eslint-plugin): [no-unused-vars] align catch behavior to ESLint 9](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8971)
  - If you want [`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`](/rules/no-unused-vars) to ignore caught errors, enable its `caughtErrors` option to `'none'` in your ESLint config

#### Replacement of `ban-types`

[`@typescript-eslint/ban-types`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/ban-types) has long been one of the more controversial rules in typescript-eslint.
It served two purposes:

- Allowing users to ban a configurable list of types from being used in type annotations
- Banning confusing or dangerous built-in types such as `Function` and `Number`

Notably, `ban-types` banned the built-in `{}` ("empty object") type in TypeScript.
The `{}` type is a common source of confusion for TypeScript developers because it matches _any non-nullable_ value, including primitives like `""`.

Banning `{}` in `ban-types` was helpful to prevent developers from accidentally using it instead of a more safe type such as `object`.
On the other hand, there are legitimate uses for `{}`, and banning it by default was harmful in those cases.

typescript-eslint v8 deletes the `ban-types` rule and replaces it with several more targeted rules:

- [`@typescript-eslint/no-restricted-types`](/rules/no-restricted-types) is the new rule for banning a configurable list of type names.
  It has no options enabled by default.
- [`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`](/rules/no-empty-object-type) bans the built-in `{}` type in confusing locations.
- [`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-function-type`](/rules/no-unsafe-function-type) bans the built-in `Function` type
- [`@typescript-eslint/no-wrapper-object-types`](/rules/no-wrapper-object-types) bans `Object` and built-in class wrappers such as `Number`.

To migrate to the new rules:

- If you were disabling the ban on `{}`, consider enabling [`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`](https://v8--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/rules/no-empty-object-type), as it allows some cases of `{}` that were previously banned.
- If you were banning any configurable types lists, provide a similar configuration to [`no-restricted-types`](/rules/no-restricted-types).
- If you have [`@typescript-eslint/ban-types`](/rules/ban-types) manually enabled, it will no longer ban:
  - `{}` or `object`: use a [recommended config](/users/configs) or manually enable [`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`](https://v8--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/rules/no-empty-object-type)
  - `Function`: use a [recommended config](/users/configs) or manually enable [`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-function-type`](https://v8--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/rules/no-unsafe-function-type)
  - `Number` or other built-in uppercase types: use a [recommended config](/users/configs) or manually enable [`@typescript-eslint/no-wrapper-object-types`](https://v8--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/rules/no-wrapper-object-types)
- If you have [`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface`](/rules/no-empty-interface) manually enabled, remove that, and instead either use a [recommended config](/users/configs) or manually enable [`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`](https://v8--typescript-eslint.netlify.app/rules/no-empty-object-type)

For more details, see the issues and pull requests that split apart the `ban-types` rule:

- [Enhancement: [ban-types] Split the {} ban into a separate, better-phrased rule](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8700)
- [feat(eslint-plugin): split no-empty-object-type out from ban-types and no-empty-interface](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8977)
- [Enhancement: [ban-types] Split into default-less no-restricted-types and more targeted type ban rule(s)](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8978)
- [feat(eslint-plugin): replace ban-types with no-restricted-types, no-unsafe-function-type, no-wrapper-object-types](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/9102)

### Tooling Breaking Changes

- ⏳ [Enhancement: Error if configuration options aren't provided as expected](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/6403)
  - This should only cause errors if you had an invalid config.
- [fix(typescript-estree): enable dot globs for project by default](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8818)
  - This will cause any `parserOptions.project` globs to match dot (`.`) directories.
    If you don't want to match them then use a more specific set of globs, or switch to `parserOptions.projectService`.
- [feat(typescript-estree): remove slow deprecated and isolated programs](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8834)
  - If you were still using `parserOptions.DEPRECATED__createDefaultProgram`, switch to `parserOptions.projectService` _(recommended)_ or `parserOptions.project`.
- [feat(typescript-estree): rename automaticSingleRunInference to disallowAutomaticSingleRunInference](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8922)
  - We've updated the default to be an opt-out - meaning you no longer need to enable it:
    ```js
    parserOptions: {
      // Remove this line
      automaticSingleRunInference: true,
      // ...
    }
    ```
- [chore: bump minimum versions for v8](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8973)
  - ESLint support range was changed from `^8.56.0` to `^8.57.0`
  - Node.js support range was changed from `^18.18.0 || >=20.0.0` to `^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0`
  - TypeScript support range was changed from `>=4.7.4 <5.5.0` to `>=4.8.4 <5.5.0`
- [Parser: remove EXPERIMENTAL_useSourceOfProjectReferenceRedirect in favor of project service](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/9088)
  - We now recommend using the new [`parserOptions.projectService`](#project-service) instead

## Developer-Facing Changes

typescript-eslint v8 comes with a suite of cleanups and improvements for developers using its Node.js APIs as well.
If you author any ESLint plugins or other tools that interact with TypeScript syntax, then we recommend you try out typescript-eslint v8 soon.
It includes some breaking changes that you may need to accommodate for.

:::tip
If you're having trouble working with the changes, please let us know on [the typescript-eslint Discord](https://discord.gg/FSxKq8Tdyg)'s `#v8` channel!
:::

### AST Breaking Changes

These changes are to the AST shapes generated by typescript-eslint when parsing code.
If you author any ESLint rules that refer to the syntax mentioned by them, these are relevant to you.

- ⏳ [Enhancement: add strict parent types for nodes that have well-defined parents](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/6225)
  - This will help you remove some unnecessary conditions - we suggest using `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition` to help find the unnecessary checks!
- [feat(typescript-estree): split TSMappedType typeParameter into constraint and key](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/7065)
  - If your code handles mapped types, change from `node.typeParameter.constraint` to `node.constraint` and from `node.typeParameter.name` to `node.key`
- [feat(ast-spec): remove deprecated type params](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8933)
  - If you haven't already you must stop using those removed AST properties that were already marked as `@deprecated`
- [fix(typescript-estree): add TSEnumBody node for TSEnumDeclaration body #8920](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8920)
  - If your code handles enums, switch from `node.members` to `node.body.members`

### Custom Rule `meta.docs` Types

`@typescript-eslint/utils` has long exported a [`RuleCreator` utility](https://typescript-eslint.io/developers/custom-rules#rulecreator) for making custom well-typed custom ESLint rules.
That `RuleCreator` is used internally by `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` — and in fact, up through typescript-eslint v7, it hardcoded the same types for rules' `meta.docs` as `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`!

In typescript-eslint v8, we've made two changes to `RuleCreator`:

- Rule `meta.docs` by default only allows the properties defined in ESLint's [Custom Rules > Rule Structure docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/custom-rules#rule-structure): `description` and `url`
- `RuleCreator` allows an optional type parameter to specify additional allowed properties

For example, this rule includes the common `meta.docs.recommended` property as a `boolean`:

```ts
interface MyPluginDocs {
  recommended: boolean;
}

const createRule = ESLintUtils.RuleCreator<MyPluginDocs>(
  name => `https://example.com/rule/${name}`,
);

createRule({
  // ...
  meta: {
    docs: {
      description: '...',
      recommended: true,
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

See [feat(utils): allow specifying additional rule meta.docs in RuleCreator](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/9025) for more details.

### Support for multi-pass fixes in `RuleTester`

The `RuleTester` provided by `@typescript-eslint/rule-tester` is a fork of ESLint's `RuleTester`.
One limitation of the original `RuleTester` is that it is not possible to verify the individual applied fixes when a rule provides multiple rounds of fixes.
[The original `RuleTester` applies only the first fix](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/integrate/nodejs-api#testing-fixes) when there is conflict between two fixes.

In typescript-eslint v8, `RuleTester` tries to apply all possible fixes for each test case.

If your rule tests had some test cases that required multi-pass fixes, you will see some test failures.
To fix these failures, provide an array of strings for `output` which specifies the output after each fix pass.

```ts
import { RuleTester } from '@typescript-eslint/rule-tester';
import rule from '../src/rules/my-rule.ts';

const ruleTester = new RuleTester();

ruleTester.run('my-rule', rule, {
  valid: [
    /* ... */
  ],
  invalid: [
    {
      code: 'const a = 1;',
      // Remove the line with string form of `output`
      output: 'const b = 1;',
      // Add the line with array form of `output`
      output: ['const b = 1;', 'const c = 1;'],
      errors: [
        /* ... */
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

See [[rule-tester] support multipass fixes](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8554) for more details.

### Other Developer-Facing Breaking Changes

- ⏳ [Repo: Rule [options] parameter should be non-nullable if defaultOptions exists](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/5439)
- [feat(parser): always enable comment, loc, range, tokens](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8617)
  - If you were manually calling `@typescript-eslint/parser` functions, those options are no longer necessary to provide
- [chore(type-utils)!: remove IsNullableTypeOptions interface](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8934)
  - If you were using `isNullableType`, you can omit its section parameter
- [feat(utils): swap LegacyESLint out for FlatESLint as ESLint export](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8972)
  - If you still need to use the class corresponding to legacy ("eslintrc") configs, switch from importing `ESLint` to `LegacyESLint`
- [chore(type-utils): remove getTypeArguments](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8938)
  - If you were using `getTypeArguments`, call a TypeScript type checker's `checker.getTypeArguments` instead
- [feat(utils): remove deprecated context helpers](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/9000)
  - You should consider dropping support for older ESLint versions and migrate to the new APIs.
