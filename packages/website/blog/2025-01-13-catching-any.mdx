TypeScript's `any` type is, by design, the single most unsafe part of its type system.
The `any` type indicates a type that can be anything and can be used in place of any other type.
Using `any` is unsafe because the type disables many of TypeScript's type-checking features and hampers its ability to provide developer assistance.

TypeScript includes a [`noImplicitAny`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noImplicitAny) flag to report when a better type than `any` can't be inferred for a value.
`noImplicitAny` is part of its family of [`strict` compiler options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict) and is generally recommended for all projects.

However, even with `noImplicitAny` enabled, the `any` type can easily sneak into codebases.
Some built-in APIs such as `JSON.stringify` and types such as `Function` can introduce the `any` type without triggering `noImplicitAny`.

typescript-eslint includes several lint rules that help prevent unsafe practices due to the `any` type.
These rules flag uses of `any` or code patterns that sneakily introduce it.

## Banning Unsafe Types

The first line of defense against `any` for many repositories is adding lint rules that report on explicitly written unsafe types.
Developers can always [disable ESLint rules with inline comments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1), so this isn't guaranteed to prevent explicit `any`s from popping up.
But these lint rules put an immediate restriction on unsafe types -- and help guide towards better alternatives.

### Banning Explicit `any`s

[`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`](/rules/no-explicit-any) reports on any instance of the `any` type written in your source code.
Doing so helps prevent developers from using `any` instead of a more safe type.

Take the following unsafe declaration of `friend: any` in a `greet` function.
Because its `friend` parameter is typed as `any` instead of `string`, TypeScript won't report a type error on a call that provides another type.
`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` would report on that `any`:

```ts
function greet(friend: any) {
  //                   ~~~
  // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any):
  // Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
  console.log(`Hello, ${friend.toUpperCase()}!`);
}

greet('Lazlo'); // Ok

greet({ name: 'Nadya' }); // Should be a type error, but isn't
```

Instead of `any`, it would have been more type safe to give `friend` the more precise type `string`.

#### Prefer `unknown`

If you have data that is of an unknown type, instead of describing it with the unsafe `any` type, prefer the safer `unknown` instead.
`unknown` is almost always preferable because it doesn't allow using the value in any arbitrary, potentially unsafe way.

[`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`](/rules/no-explicit-any)'s rule reports include a suggestion fixer that switches the explicit `any` to `unknown`.

### Banning `Function`

[`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-function-type`](/rules/no-unsafe-function-type) reports on any instance of the built-in `Function` type written in source code.
`Function` is a loose, unsafe type: it allows being called with any number of arguments and returns type `any`.

Take the following version of `greet` that takes in a function for its parameter.
`Function` doesn't describe any parameter or return types, so TypeScript can't know what types it's meant to take in or return.
`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-function-type` would report on that `Function`:

```ts
function greet(getFriend: Function) {
  //                      ~~~~~~~~
  // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-function-type):
  // The `Function` type accepts any function-like value.
  // Prefer explicitly defining any function parameters and return type.
  console.log(`Hello, ${getFriend().toUpperCase()}!`);
}

greet(() => 'Lazlo'); // Ok

greet(() => ({ name: 'Nadya' })); // Should be a type error, but isn't
```

Instead of `Function`, it would have been more type safe to give `getFriend` the more precise type `() => string`.

### Enforcing `unknown` for Caught Exceptions

There is no `throws` keyword or other way to enforce types of exceptions in TypeScript[^no-throws], so their types can only be declared as `any` or `unknown`.
Caught exceptions in `catch` blocks and `Promise` rejections are, by default, typed as `any` in TypeScript.
TypeScript's [`useUnknownInCatchVariables`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#useUnknownInCatchVariables) changes `catch` block exceptions to `unknown`, but no compiler option equivalent exists for `Promise` rejections.

[`@typescript-eslint/use-unknown-in-catch-callback-variable`](/rules/use-unknown-in-catch-callback-variable) enforces always using the unknown type for the parameter of a Promise rejection callback.

For example, given the following code, TypeScript would not report a type error, but the lint rule would report:

```ts
function rejectWith(value: string) {
  return Promise.reject(value);
}

rejectWith('Nandor').catch(error => {
  //                       ~~~~~
  // eslint(@typescript-eslint/use-unknown-in-catch-callback-variable):
  // Prefer the safe `: unknown` for a `catch` callback variable.

  console.log(error.message); // Should be a type error, but isn't
});
```

Had the `error` been given a `: unknown` type, TypeScript would be able to report on `error.message` as being unsafe.

## Banning Usage of Unsafe Types

Once an `any` type exists in code, it is "infectious": it can turn the types of values based on it into more `any`s.

typescript-eslint includes a collection of rules that flag code patterns which spread or are generally made less safe due to an `any`.
Each of the following rules reports on a specific use of `any`.

- [`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument`](/rules/no-unsafe-argument) reports on passing an `any` typed value to a function call:

  ```ts
  declare function greet(friend: string): void;

  function greetFromData(raw: string) {
    greet(JSON.parse(raw));
    //    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument):
    // Unsafe argument of type `any` assigned to a parameter of type `string`.
  }
  ```

* [`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment`](/rules/no-unsafe-assignment) reports on assigning an `any` typed value to a property or variable:

  ```ts
  const person = {
    name: '(anonymous)',
  };

  function setNameFromData(raw: string) {
    person.name = JSON.parse(raw);
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment):
    // Unsafe assignment of an `any` value.
  }
  ```

* [`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call`](/rules/no-unsafe-call) reports on calling an `any` typed value like a function:

  ```ts
  const person = {
    name: '(anonymous)',
  };

  function setNameFromData(raw: string) {
    person.name = JSON.parse(raw);
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument):
    // Unsafe assignment of an `any` value.
  }
  ```

* [`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access`](/rules/no-unsafe-member-access) reports on accessing members of any value typed as `any`:

  ```ts
  function setNameOnData(raw: string) {
    const data = JSON.parse(raw);

    data.name = 'Colin';
    //   ~~~~
    // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access):
    // Unsafe member access .name on an `any` value.
  }
  ```

* [`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return`](/rules/no-unsafe-return) reports on returning a value typed as `any` from a function:

  ```ts
  function returnData(raw: string) {
    return JSON.parse(raw);
    // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return):
    // Unsafe return of a value of type `any`.
  }
  ```

Put together, the `@typescript-eslint/no-unusafe-*` rules provide a comprehensive suite of checks that can flag most accidental uses of `any` across a codebase.
We highly recommend using them alongside TypeScript's `noImplicitAny` compiler option.

## Additional Helpers

### Disabling TypeScript Suppressions

The `any` type is not the only way to bypass TypeScript's type system.
Developers are also able to use inline TypeScript directives: `// @ts-expect-error` and `// @ts-ignore`.
Those inline comment directives cause TypeScript to ignore type errors on a line.
Disabling TypeScript on a per-line basis can sometimes be necessary in rare cases, but is always unsafe and almost never the right choice.

:::tip
`// @ts-expect-error` and `// @ts-ignore` are almost the same, except `// @ts-expect-error` will produce a new type error if its line doesn't already have one.
It's generally preferable to use `// @ts-expect-error` over `// @ts-ignore`.
:::

[`@typescript-eslint/ban-comment`](/rules/ban-ts-comment) can be used to report on cases where developers use TypeScript comment directives.
By default, the rule:

- Always reports on `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` comment directives
- Reports on `@ts-expect-error` directives that don't have an explanatory comment description
- Requires explanatory comment descriptions contain at least 3 characters

For example, suppose `"@example/package"` exports a `process` function that should take in a `string` but whose types incorrectly indicate take in a `number`.
A `// @ts-expect-error` comment could be used to tell TypeScript to ignore the line:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
import { process } from '@example/package';

// @ts-ignore
process('New York City');
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
import { process } from '@example/package';

// @ts-expect-error -- Pending updating the process types. See GH-1234.
process('New York City');
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the types for `@example/package` are fixed to no longer produce a type error, the comment directive will itself produce a type error asking to delete itself.

### ESLint Comments Plugin

ESLint includes its own inline comment directives separate from TypeScript's.
`// eslint-disable`, `// eslint-disable-next-line`, and other inline ESLint config comments can suppress lint rules — including those mentioned in this post.
Suppressing ESLint rules can also occasionally be necessary in cases where the rule and/or TypeScript's type system have misunderstand your code.

If you absolutely must use ESLint comment directives, we recommend utilizing [`@eslint-community/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments`](https://eslint-community.github.io/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments).
The plugin's [recommended preset](https://eslint-community.github.io/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/#%F0%9F%93%96-usage) enables rules that enforce best practices around ESLint comment directives, including:

- [`@eslint-community/eslint-comments/disable-enable-pair`](https://eslint-community.github.io/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/rules/disable-enable-pair.html): to prevent accidentally disabling rules for the rest of a file, rather than on specific lines
- [`@eslint-community/eslint-comments/no-unlimited-disable`](https://eslint-community.github.io/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/rules/no-unlimited-disable.html): to prevent accidentally disabling all ESLint rules, rather than specific ones
- [`@eslint-community/eslint-comments/require-description`](https://eslint-community.github.io/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/rules/require-description.html): to require comments explaining why directives are necessary

For example, suppose the type of an imported `process` is temporarily `any` pending some soon-to-be-completed task.
It might be reasonable to include an ESLint disable comment to suppress a lint rule reporting on the `any`.
That comment should ideally include an explanation and link to the pending task, so developers know it's not normal to disable lint rules without good reason:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
import { process } from '@example/package';

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call
process('New York City');
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
import { process } from '@example/package';

// Pending GH-1234: will soon not be any.
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call
process('New York City');
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the types for `@example/package` are fixed to no longer produce an `any`, running ESLint with [`reportUnusedDisableDirectives`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#report-unused-eslint-disable-comments) option will produce a lint report asking to remove the comment directive.

### `ts-reset`

Some sources of `any` come from built-in global types provided by TypeScript.
[`JSON.parse()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse), [`.json()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json), and [`Storage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API#basic_concepts) properties are all typed as `any` by default in TypeScript.
TypeScript keeps `any` in the types for legacy support reasons[^compiler-option-lib-any].

The [`ts-reset`](https://www.totaltypescript.com/ts-reset) library switches those global type definitions to safer equivalents.
It switches the `any`s in those built-in types to `unknown`.

With `ts-reset`, the following `data` variable would switch from being type `any` to `unknown`:

```ts
const data = JSON.parse(`"clearly-a-string"`);
//    ^? any (without ts-reset)
//    ^? unknown (with ts-reset)

console.log(data.some.property.that.does.not.exist);
```

Note that `ts-reset` applies globally, so it should only be used in application code.

## Next Steps

We highly recommend using at least the [`tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked`](/users/configs#recommended-type-checked) preset in your ESLint configuration.
It enables the `no-explicit-any` and `no-unsafe-*` lint rules mentioned in this blog post, as well as a large set of other rules that help enforce type safety and TypeScript best practices.

If you're interested in achieving stronger type safety with more strict linting, consider upgrading to the [`tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`](/users/configs#strict-type-checked) preset.
It includes all the recommended rules, as well as `use-unknown-incatch-callback-variable` and other rules that enforce more strict type safety and TypeScript best practices.
